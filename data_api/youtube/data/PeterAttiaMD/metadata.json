In this episode, Alex delves into two interconnected topics: liquid biopsies and epigenetics. He begins by tracing the trajectory of genome sequencing and tumor sequencing, setting the stage for a detailed exploration of liquid biopsies as an early cancer detection method. The discussion encompasses key concepts such as cell-free DNA, DNA methylation, sensitivity, specificity, and the predictive values associated with liquid biopsies. Transitioning to epigenetics, Alex examines the intricate interplay of DNA methylation and aging biology and explores the possibility of using cellular reprogramming to reverse epigenetic changes that occur with aging.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Alex\u2019s background in applying engineering to problems in medicine\n0:19:57 - A primer on human genetics, and the history and current landscape of DNA sequencing\n0:24:05 - The advent and evolution of liquid biopsies for early detection of cancer\n0:44:14 - The role of cell-free DNA in cancer detection: how incidental findings in non-invasive prenatal testing led to the development of liquid biopsies\n0:51:05 - The development of a universal blood test for cancer detection and a discussion of specificity of tests\n0:56:48 - Advancements in cell-free DNA analysis and development of a multi-cancer screening test at GRAIL\n1:05:27 - DNA methylation explained\n1:11:00 - Optimizing cancer detection with methylation analysis of cfDNA in small blood samples\n1:17:22 - The importance of understanding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in cancer screening\n1:32:57 - The performance of the GRAIL Galleri test and its ability to detect various types and stages of cancer\n1:41:05 - Do early cancer detection methods, like liquid biopsies, translate to improvement in overall survival?\n1:54:45 - The role of epigenetics in aging\n2:01:58 - How cell-free DNA methylation patterns can help identify a cancer\u2019s tissue of origin\n2:09:48 - Cellular and epigenetic reprogramming and other exciting work in the field of aging\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

Peter examines the arguments both for and against cancer screening, including addressing why some trials may show no benefit to screening. He then delves into the various screening modalities available for different cancers, highlights the pros and cons associated with each, and explains how to interpret the results. Additionally, Peter provides guidance for navigating outside of the relatively narrow and confined screening guidelines for various types of screening tests.\n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:12 - Why understanding cancer screening is crucial\n02:08 - The prevalence of cancer diagnosis and mortality rates\n09:09 - Why cancer screening and early detection is such an important part of the strategy to survive a cancer diagnosis\n11:18 - Data on how cancer screening impacts survivability of cancer\n14:45 - Inconsistencies between cancer screening trials regarding benefits to survival rates\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-What are some of the reasons why clinical trials don\u2019t always improve cancer-specific mortality?;\n-What are the arguments against population-level cancer screening?;\n-Cancer screening outside the recommended guidelines: risks and benefits, interpreting results, and other considerations;\n-Understanding sensitivity and specificity when reviewing screening results;\n-Risks and complications associated with colonoscopies;\n-Cancer screening modalities: options for cancer screening both within standard recommendations and beyond;\n-The strengths and limitations of various types of cancer screening;\n-Understanding positive and negative predictive value using sensitivity, specificity, and pretest probability;\n-Factors that influence an individual's pretest probability of cancer;\n-How to interpret cancer screening results;\n-The importance of having an advocate when considering out-of-guideline cancer screening tests;\n-How stacking multiple cancer screening modalities can decrease the risk of false positives;\n-Advice and guidance for making decisions related to cancer screening; and\n-More.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

In this episode, Michael explores the evolutionary backdrop that molded human beings, a setting characterized by scarce food, limited information, and few possessions. He contrasts that with the modern era, marked by abundance and comfort, and the ensuing repercussions on our physical and mental well-being. Michael introduces the concept of the \u201cscarcity loop,\u201d a three-part behavior cycle which helps explain modern challenges such as overeating, addiction, gambling, and materialism, and offers practical strategies to break free from its cycle. The episode culminates in a thought-provoking exploration of happiness, drawing on Michael's experiences with monks and underscoring the value of boredom, exploration, and discomfort as transformative elements that elevate awareness, presence, and the will to live.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:47 - Inspiration for Michael\u2019s latest book, Scarcity Brain\n0:02:45 - Evolutionary adaptations to the scarcity of food contrasted with the modern obesity crisis\n0:09:22 - Lessons learned about diet and nutrition from living with hunter-gatherers\n0:21:29 - The impact of ultra-processed foods on energy balance\n0:29:33 - Michael\u2019s experience with attempting the hunter-gatherer diet at home\n0:36:22 - The roots of excess: factors that contribute to overeating and the varied vulnerabilities among individuals\n0:42:53 - The scarcity loop: how components of the scarcity loop are illustrated in gambling and addiction\n0:55:05 - Using knowledge of the scarcity loop to break the cycle\n1:03:09 - The evolutionary drive to acquire material possessions\n1:12:56 - The benefits of boredom and value of exploration\n1:23:27 - The consequences of an attention economy driven by negativity bias\n1:30:38 - Navigating the world of endless information and the value in \u201cslow information\u201d\n1:41:57 - Defining happiness, and the downward trend in reports of happiness\n1:48:06 - Purpose, austerity, self-reliance and other missing elements of happiness gleaned from the study of monks\n2:00:12 - The value in uncomfortable activities that increase your awareness, presence, and will to live\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

I say this b/c I realize that most people\u2014my patients included\u2014don\u2019t want to use a lactate meter to confirm they are there. And I get it. I\u2019m an unusual guy in my love for precision and data. Furthermore, when you\u2019re starting out\u2014and if you are very deconditioned\u2014using a lactate threshold of 1.7 to 1.9 mM is not going to work because your resting lactate can easily be in that range! (A healthy and fit person will have a resting lactate typically below 0.5 mM).\n\nFurthermore, while there are lots of ways to estimate zone 2 with HR (I think the best way is Phil Maffetone\u2019s rule of 180-age +/- 5-10 based on fitness) and power (as a function of FTP, for example), these take you away from you developing a real FEELING for the exercise. So, instead I want people to titrate with RPE and monitor (read: RECORD) power and HR. I have logged my steady state HR, average power, and lactate for every zone 2 ride I\u2019ve done since 2018 and it provides amazing insights! The most notable of these is that the ONLY constant is RPE.\n\n(Oh, one more thing\u2026 to the folks watching this video who are wondering why my hat says \u201cMarlboro\u201d \u2026 no I\u2019m not endorsing tobacco!

In this episode, Arthur returns to the podcast to discuss his new book, Build the Life You Want. He delves into the nuanced concept of happiness, differentiating between momentary feelings and overall wellbeing. He explains the importance of understanding one\u2019s personality pattern with respect to positive and negative emotions in order to better self-manage emotions. He delves into the three key elements of happiness, offering practical strategies for enhancing those specific domains through methods such as metacognition, transcendent experiences, discipline, minimizing self-focus while directing attention outward, and more. Through personal examples, Arthur demonstrates that one can actively track well-being levels and take intentional steps to cultivate happiness and enhance overall well-being.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:01:11 - Happiness vs. happy feelings, and how happiness and unhappiness can coexist\n0:04:55 - The six fundamental emotions\n0:15:29 - The evolution and heritability of happiness, and the four personality patterns with respect to positive and negative emotions\n0:22:15 - Navigating relationships: the power of complementarity over compatibility\n0:24:28 - The importance of self-managing your mental habits\n0:31:31 - Enjoyment: one of the three macronutrients of happiness\n0:44:25 - Satisfaction: one of the three macronutrients of happiness\n0:52:14 - The reverse bucket list, metacognition, and other techniques to protect yourself from your limbic system\n0:59:15 - Meaning: one of the three macronutrients of happiness\n1:07:55 - The four quarters of your life and how that relates to the meaning of your life\n1:12:03 - Putting metacognition into practice\n1:20:55 - What might explain the societal downdrift in happiness over the last few decades?\n1:36:07 - Taking charge of your happiness: discipline, transcendent experiences, and other deliberate actions for happiness\n1:49:17 - Tracking happiness: biomarkers and micronutrients behind the macronutrients of happiness\n1:57:52 - The value in minimizing the self and looking outward\n2:02:23 - How Arthur surprised himself with his ability to improve his happiness\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

In terms of individual lives saved, you could argue that there is no other person on the front lines doing more than Tom. Additionally, we explore the manner in which the Nuba people die, which is in striking contrast to the ubiquity of chronic disease and self-harm in the West, despite the extreme poverty and unimaginable suffering experienced by the Nuba people.

David & Matt begin by telling the fascinating story of the discovery of rapamycin & its brief history as a pharmacological agent in humans. They then unravel the function of mTOR, a central regulator of numerous biological processes, & they discuss the pathways through which rapamycin exerts its potential benefits on lifespan. They touch upon initial studies that suggested rapamycin may have geroprotective effects & the ongoing research that continues to shed light on this unique molecule. Furthermore, they discuss the elusive details surrounding the frequency & dosing of rapamycin use in humans, & Peter emphasizes his reservations about indiscriminately prescribing rapamycin as a longevity drug for patients.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00-Intro\n0:01:00-David & Matt\u2019s expertise in mTOR & rapamycin\n0:12:00-The discovery of rapamycin & first use in humans as an immunosuppressant\n0:19:05-Emergence of rapamycin as a molecule with the potential to prolong lifespan\n0:25:53-Groundbreaking rapamycin study on mouse lifespan extension & the open questions about the timing & frequency of dosing\n0:36:26-Explaining mTOR & the biology behind rapamycin\u2019s effects\n0:47:13-Differences in how rapamycin inhibits mTOR complex 1 (MTORC1) versus mTOR complex 2 (MTORC2)\n0:51:20-Reconciling the biochemical mechanism of rapamycin with its longevity benefit\n0:56:42-Important discoveries about the interplay of amino acids (leucine in particular) & mTOR\n1:04:43-Reconciling rapamycin-mediated mTOR inhibition with mTOR's significance in building & maintaining muscle\n1:12:00-Unanswered questions around the tissue specificity of rapamycin\n1:18:09-Rapamycin\u2019s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier & its potential impacts on brain health & neurodegeneration\n1:26:40-Rapamycin may act as an immune modulator in addition to immunosuppressive effects\n1:40:41-Might rapamycin induce changes in T cell methylation patterns, potentially reversing biological aging?\n1:49:00-Rapamycin side effects & impacts on mental health: fascinating results of Matt\u2019s survey on off-label rapamycin use\n1:59:32-Impact of taking rapamycin in people who contracted COVID-19: more insights from Matt\u2019s survey\n2:05:20-What David would like to study with mTOR inhibitors\n2:09:50-Joan Mannick\u2019s studies of RTB101 & other ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR\n2:20:10-Impact of mTOR inhibition on autophagy & inflammation & a discussion of biomarkers\n2:28:24-The Dog Aging Project: what we\u2019ve learned from testing rapamycin in dogs\n2:36:20-Preliminary results of primate studies with rapamycin\n2:39:31-Dosing of rapamycin\n2:49:33-Effect of rapamycin on fertility\n2:55:30-Outlook for future research of rapamycin & the development of rapalogs\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, & all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

He examines the available data on these drugs, assessing their comparative effectiveness and their potential in the context of lifestyle interventions. Additionally, he offers insights into whether SGLT2 inhibitors hold promise as geroprotective agents beyond their effects on glycemic control. Next, Peter analyzes the relationship between statin usage and the risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, investigating possible causal pathways and providing insights into strategies for risk reduction. He offers insights on monitoring adverse statin effects and evaluating the need for adjustments, ultimately weighing the trade-off between the risk to overall metabolic health against the benefits of reducing apoB levels through statin use.\n\nIn this sneak peak, we discuss:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - Pharmacologic tools for improving metabolic health, and the relationship between statins and insulin resistance\n02:45 - SGLT-2 inhibitors: how they work and help to manage type 2 diabetes\n09:10 - The history of SGLT2 inhibitors \u2013 from discovery to the current state\n14:45 - Comparing the various FDA-approved SGLT2 inhibitors\n20:37 - Other beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors outside of glycemic control\n23:32 - Exploring SGLT2 inhibitors as potential geroprotective molecules\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-The side effects and risks associated with SGLT2 inhibitors;\n-Medications, lifestyle interventions, and other considerations for treating diabetes and improving metabolic health;\n-Metformin as a tool for pre-diabetics, and how metformin compares to lifestyle interventions;\n-How GLP-1 agonists compare to metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors in terms of glycemic control and weight loss;\n-Exploring the relationship between statin use and the risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes;\n-Possible mechanisms of statin-induced insulin resistance and diabetes, and potential mitigation strategies;\n-How to monitor for adverse effects of statin use and assess the need for adjustments;\n-Weighing the benefits and risks of statin use: does the diabetes risk outweigh the benefits of lowering apoB with a statin?;\n-Parting thoughts; and\n-More.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

In this episode, Wendy delves deep into the world of genetics by first exploring the historical landscape of genetics prior to decoding the human genome, contrasting it with what we know today thanks to whole genome and exome sequencing. She provides an overview of genetic testing by differentiating between various genetic tests such as direct-to-consumer, clinical, whole genome sequencing, and more. Additionally, Wendy unravels the genetic underpinnings of conditions such as PKU, breast cancer, obesity, autism, and cardiovascular disease. Finally, Wendy goes in depth on the current state and exciting potential of gene therapy while also contemplating the economic implications and ethical nature of gene editing.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:38 - Wendy\u2019s interest in genetics and work as a physician-scientist\n0:03:25 - The genetics of phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder\n0:17:28 - The evolution of genetic research: from DNA structure to whole genome sequencing\n0:28:43 - Insights and surprises that came out of the Human Genome Project\n0:35:09 - Overview of various types of genetic tests: direct-to-consumer, clinical, whole genome sequencing, and more\n0:40:50 - Whole genome sequencing\n0:46:59 - Germline mutations and the implications for older parents\n0:52:31 - Whole exome sequencing and the importance of read depth\n0:56:21 - Genetic testing for breast cancer\n1:04:12 - What information does direct-to-consumer testing provide (from companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.com)?\n1:09:42 - The GUARDIAN study and newborn genetic screening\n1:21:57 - Treating genetic disease with gene therapy\n1:26:28 - How gene therapy works, and the tragic story of Jesse Gelsinger\n1:33:05 - Use cases for gene therapy, gene addition vs. gene editing, CRISPR, and more\n1:43:03 - Two distinct gene editing strategies for addressing Tay-Sachs and fragile X syndrome\n1:47:40 - Exploring obesity as a polygenic disease: heritability, epigenetics, and more\n1:55:55 - The genetics of autism\n2:10:24 - The genetics of cardiovascular disease\n2:15:28 - The financial costs and economic considerations of gene therapy\n2:21:37 - The ethics of gene editing\n2:31:55 - The future of clinical genetics\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

In this episode, Oliver delves into the pervasive idea that time can be mastered, exploring whether maximizing productivity is an attainable goal or a perpetual trap. He discusses the allure of attempting to control time\u2014and, therefore, the future\u2014and shares his personal journey of experimenting with diverse time management techniques that failed to deliver the emotional satisfaction he sought. Ultimately, they explore the mismatch between being a finite human and existing in a world of infinite possibilities and how all of these concepts intertwine with finding a sense of purpose and meaning. Additionally, Oliver shares insights from his book on productivity, using our time wisely, and embracing our finitude to live a more fulfilling life.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:02:16 - Oliver\u2019s experience that led him to write the book Four Thousand Weeks\n0:05:59 - Human\u2019s relationship with time and the struggle with the finite nature of time\n0:10:15 - How productivity can be a trap\n0:17:45 - The fallacy that being more efficient will open up more time and bring a feeling of control\n0:25:14 - The paradoxical nature of trying too hard to be present in the current moment\n0:30:33 - The value of relationships in meaningful experiences and fulfillment, and how time gets its value from being shared\n0:42:09 - The importance of time synchronicity\n0:48:07 - Identifying your biggest priorities and the paradox of wanting to do more than you have time for\n0:55:37 - Oliver\u2019s moment of clarity in 2014\n0:59:25 - The role of a sense of purpose in fulfillment\n1:10:36 - Reconciling the finite nature of time and letting go of trying to master your time\n1:18:58 - Why we tend to have a future-focused attitude and how to combat that with atelic activities\n1:27:36 - The power of shifting your perspective about time and your experiences\n1:36:54 - How to operationalize the three principles for the dilemma of finite time\n1:46:05 - Harnessing the power of patience in the face of a problem or experience\n1:53:58 - The value of incrementalism for being productive\n1:58:34 - Embracing your finitude with curiosity\n2:02:10 - Acting on an idea in the moment rather than letting the idea be the obstacle\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

In this episode, Sharon tackles the topic of women's sexual health, including the conditions associated with decreased sexual function and desire and available treatment options.

I typically do this as the final or penultimate movement prep of 5-6 warm-up exercise before moving to major lifts.\n\nIt\u2019s multiplanar, obviously, so it\u2019s getting my ankles and feet ready for complex movement and getting my glutes, hamstrings, and to a lesser extent quads firing.\n\nThere are many ways to do this (4-way instead of 3-way); pause in the middle with knee to chest or different variations with standing hip rotations. I\u2019ll post on those another time, but this is the simplest of the lot and yet still immensely valuable to me.\n\nI\u2019ll do 2 sets of 6 per side typically.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

In this episode, Tommy delves into the complexities of age-related cognitive decline and explores interventions to counteract it. Drawing from his experience working with Formula 1 drivers, he highlights the connection between cognitive function and the right type of demands and training leading to improvement. Next, he explores the various theories on the different types of pathology in dementia and neurodegeneration. He makes the case that a large fraction of dementia is preventable through lifestyle choices and nutrient status, and provides an in-depth overview of interventions and supplements that support cognitive function. Finally, he provides a comprehensive overview of head injuries, including concussions and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), discussing symptoms, how to mitigate damage following an incident, and long-term management.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Tommy\u2019s professional work, unique skill sets, and interests\n0:03:27 - Age-related decline in cognitive function and memory\n0:19:58 - Improving brain function with the right level and type of demand\n0:32:57 - Formula 1 as a model for how to perform under high cognitive demand and how to increase multitasking capacity\n0:39:54 - Advice for the person reaching middle life looking to mitigate cognitive decline\n0:48:42 - Tasks and activities that support and improve cognitive function\n0:53:25 - Neuropathology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease: exploring the role of amyloid and tau proteins\n1:11:48 - Why Tommy believes dementia research funding should be focused on environmental and lifestyle-based risk factors\n1:15:57 - Benefits of lowering homocysteine and boosting omega-3\u2019s, and evidence-based supplements that support cognitive function\n1:29:40 - A unifying theory of dementia\n1:33:29 - How muscular strength can help with both the prevention and survivability of dementia\n1:39:24 - Head injuries: comparing concussions against traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), mitigating the damage after an incident, and the long-term management of head injuries\n1:58:33 - Is hyperbaric oxygen treatment helpful after a TBI?\n2:03:07 - Supplements that aid recovery from a TBI: creatine, DHA, and choline\n2:12:16 - Demands faced by F1 drivers, and testing interventions to improve their performance\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

So, in this situation, stepping up (concentric) is rep 1; stepping down (eccentric) is rep 2; next step up is rep 3; and so on.\n\nDoing this is a helpful cue to place as much (if not more) emphasis on the eccentric phase, which most people grossly under-train. Eccentric strength produces the capacity for deceleration. If you can\u2019t effectively slow yourself down, you will get injured. Full stop. This is as true as Tuesday following Monday. So be sure you are always incorporating eccentric training into all of your lifts.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

In this discussion, John delves deep into familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood that increases the risk of developing heart disease. He covers its definition, genetic underpinnings, and clinical identification. He then explores the therapeutic options available for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, including the captivating history of CETP inhibitors. He explains the past shortcomings of previous CETP inhibitors before underscoring the compelling potential of the latest iterations, not only for cardiovascular disease but also for conditions like Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, he unveils the intricate role of APOE, shedding light on why the APOE4 isoform codes for a protein that significantly increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. Concluding the discussion, John shares a profound sense of optimism, envisioning the possibility of targeted therapeutic interventions for high-risk patients in the near future.\n\nWe discuss:\nIntro [0:00]\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH): a genetic condition [4:30];\nDifferentiating between phenotype and genotype when it comes to FH [9:45];\nThe pathophysiology related to mutations of FH [15:30];\nClinical presentations, physical manifestations, and diagnosis of FH [22:00];\nCriteria used to make a formal diagnosis of FH [30:15];\nWhy a small fraction of people with FH do not develop premature ASCVD [34:15];\nTreatment and prevention for those with FH [39:45];\nAddressing the assertion by some that elevated LDL is not casual in cardiovascular disease [52:45];\nThe history of CETP inhibitors and the role of the CETP protein [55:45];\nThe thrifty gene hypothesis and why genes underlying FH may have been preserved [1:09:00];\nThe compelling potential of the latest CETP inhibitor (obicetrapib) [1:13:00];\nPromising results from phase 3 trials exploring obicetrapib [1:27:45];\nWhy the APOE4 allele increases the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and the connection to blood lipids [1:41:30];\nThe role of APOE in cardiovascular disease [1:51:45];\u00a0\nTakeaways and looking ahead [1:57:00]; and\nMore.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

Lower leg variability is a very important part of stability. If you think about it, everything we\u2019re doing requires us to be connected to the ground. The more you ask of your body\u2014lifting something heavy, shifting direction quickly\u2014requires force transfer from you to the ground and from the ground to you. And that\u2019s all being transmitted via your feet. Hence, the better your ability to start and stop in any direction, the more effectively you can lift/move safely. For this drill, if you struggle to do it as I\u2019ve shown, start with both feet at the same time until that becomes easy and then progress to single leg.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

In this episode, she dives deep into the WHI to explain the study design, primary outcome, confounding factors, and nuanced benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). JoAnn reflects on how a misinterpretation of the results, combined with sensationalized headlines regarding an elevated risk of breast cancer, led to a significant shift in the perception and utilization of HRT. From there, they take a closer look at the breast cancer data to separate fact from fiction. Additionally, JoAnn gives her take on how one should weigh the risks and benefits of HRT and concludes with a discussion on how physicians can move towards better HRT practices. \n\nWe discuss:\nIntro [0:00]\nThe Women\u2019s Health Initiative: the original goal of the study, hormone formulations used, and potential confounders [4:15];\nStudy design of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative, primary outcome, and more [16:00];\nJoAnn\u2019s personal hypothesis about the ability of hormone replacement therapy to reduce heart disease risk prior to the WHI [26:45];\nThe relationship between estrogen and breast cancer [30:45];\nWhy the WHI study was stopped early, and the dramatic change in the perception and use of HRT due to the alleged increase in breast cancer risk [37:30];\nWhat Peter finds most troubling about the mainstream view of HRT and a more nuanced look at the benefits and risks of HRT [45:15];\nHRT and bone health [56:00];\nThe importance of timing when it comes to HRT, the best use cases, and advice on finding a clinician [59:30];\nA discussion on the potential impact of HRT on mortality and a thought experiment on a long-duration use of HRT [1:03:15];\nMoving toward better HRT practices, and the need for more studies [1:10:00]; and\nMore.\n\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing longevity, and all that goes into that from physical to cognitive to emotional health.

He first dives deep into GLP-1 agonists, most notably semaglutide and tirzepatide, which originally came to market as diabetes drugs but are now being studied and prescribed for weight loss. He walks through the data and compares the effectiveness of the two drugs, the side effects, and perhaps more importantly, his reservations around wide use of these drugs and who he would consider to be a candidate for them. Next, Peter discusses how metformin, another drug originally brought to market for diabetes management, gained popularity as a potential longevity drug even for non-diabetics. Peter gives his take on this possibility and reviews data from a more recent study investigating the question of whether metformin should be used for general \u201cgeroprotection.\u201d\n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - The hype around semaglutide, tirzepatide, and other GLP-1 agonists for weight loss\n04:09 - Overview of GLP-1 agonists and why these drugs are getting so much attention\n12:20 - Defining the term \u201cgeroprotective\u201d\n14:08 - Semaglutide: background, brand names, indications, and more\n19:10 - Tirzepatide: background, brand names, indications, and more\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-How semaglutide and tirzepatide compare in their efficacy in terms of weight loss and other metabolic health metrics;\n-Data showing sustained weight loss and improved metabolic metrics with after more than a year of using semaglutide and tirzepatide;\n-What happens to body weight when a patient discontinues the medication?;\n-Noteworthy side effects of GLP-1 agonists and similar classes of drugs;\n-Increased resting heart rate and other concerning trends in patients using GLP-1 agonists;\n-Changes in body composition (body fat and lean muscle) in patients on GLP-1 agonists;\n-Possible reasons for the loss of lean muscle mass and tips for protecting lean mass;\n-GLP-1 agonists and thyroid cancer;\n-Who might be a candidate for GLP-1 agonists?;\n-The large financial cost of this class of drugs;\n-Metformin as a geroprotective drug: origin of the idea that metformin could be a longevity agent even for non-diabetic patients;\n-A 2022 study on metformin sheds more light on the question of whether metformin should be used for \u201cgeroprotection\u201d in non-diabetics;\n-Peter\u2019s current approach with metformin for his patients; and\n-More.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Lewis opens up about the various hardships and traumatic events he experienced starting at a very young age and reveals the valuable lessons he learned as he worked through those traumas to improve his emotional health. He talks about how his past hardships likely contributed to his success in business and athletics, only to leave him feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

In this episode, Dan goes in-depth on HDL biology, including the genesis of HDL, its metabolism, function, and how this relates to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). He explains why having high HDL-C levels does not directly translate to a low risk of cardiovascular disease and reveals research pointing to a better way to measure the functionality of HDL and predict disease risk. He also goes into detail on the role of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport and the benefits this has for reducing ASCVD. Additionally, Dan discusses the latest thinking around the association between HDL cholesterol and neurodegenerative diseases and ends the conversation with a discussion of how the latest research on HDL provides a promising outlook for ongoing trials and future therapeutic interventions.\n\nWe discuss:\n-The lipidology of apoB and apoA [4:00];\n-A primer on the high-density lipoprotein (HDL): genesis, structure, and more [9:30];\n-How the lipoprotein system differs in humans compared to other mammals [20:00];\n-Clarifying the terminology around HDL and apoA [25:30];\nHDL metabolism [31:45];\n-CETP inhibitors for raising HDL-C: does it reduce CVD risk?

In this episode, Kellyann provides an overview of the various diseases associated with neurodegeneration, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. She goes in-depth on Parkinson\u2019s disease, explaining its pathology, role in movement capacity, very early warning signs, and the role of anxiety and sleep. Similarly, she provides an in-depth discussion of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, including the latest in screening, genetics, and tools/strategies for prevention. She ties the discussion together by explaining the differences and commonalities among the various diseases of neurodegeneration and the potential causative triggers, and she highlights the importance of early screening, cognitive testing, and taking the proper steps to lowering the risk of disease.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Kellyann\u2019s background, training, and interest in the brain\n0:03:33 - A primer on neurodegeneration: different types, prevalences, interventions, and more\n0:14:44 - Overview of Parkinson\u2019s disease and neuromuscular disorders including ALS\n0:16:26 - Parkinson\u2019s disease: early signs, diagnosis, genetics, causative triggers, and more\n0:31:12 - Interventions to delay or avoid Parkinson\u2019s disease, and the role of sleep and anxiety\n0:40:26 - The challenge of standardizing early interventions for Parkinson\u2019s disease without a clear biomarker\n0:49:22 - Alzheimer\u2019s disease: pathophysiology and the role of the amyloid and tau proteins\n0:53:16 - Can PET scans be informative for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\n0:59:28 - Tau accumulation in the brain, tau scans, serum biomarkers, and possible early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology\n1:06:43 - Cognitive testing explained\n1:18:55 - The challenge of identifying the stage of the disease and why drugs have not shown efficacy\n1:22:23 - The association between hearing loss and dementia\n1:26:39 - The relationship between oral health and neurodegenerative diseases\n1:29:58 - Genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n1:39:17 - What one\u2019s mitochondrial haplotype can reveal about their risk of neurodegenerative disease\n1:43:23 - The positive impact of exercise on brain health\n1:46:34 - High blood pressure as a risk factor\n1:51:22 - Why women are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n1:54:14 - Final takeaways: the future of understanding neurodegenerative disease and further reducing risk\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Erin discusses current trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) through the lens of female biology and the observation that major adverse cardiac events in both sexes are on the rise. She walks through risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, apoB, and Lp(a) and makes the case for the importance of early preventative measures. She explains various interventions for reducing risk including a discussion of statins, GLP-1 agonists, PCSK9-inhibitors, and drugs that lower Lp(a). She goes in-depth on female-specific factors that contribute to CVD risk such as pregnancy, grand multiparity (having five or more children), oral contraceptives, menopause, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Additionally, she explains her approach with patients as it relates to the use of hormone replacement therapy and provides advice for people wanting to lower risk both through lifestyle changes & medications.\n\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:02:30 - Erin\u2019s background in preventive cardiology\n0:05:15 - Recent trends in cardiovascular disease in women, mortality data, & how it compares to cancer\n0:13:15 - Why early preventative measures are critical for CVD risk\n0:19:45 - ApoB as a causal agent of CVD, & why high apoB levels are not being aggressively treated\n0:27:00 - The rising trend of metabolic syndrome & other factors contributing to the regression in progress of reducing cardiac events\n0:33:30 - GLP-1 agonists\u2014Promising drugs for diabetes & obesity\n0:37:15 - Female-specific risk factors for ASCVD\n0:47:00 - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): prevalence, etiology, & impact on metabolic health, lipids & fertility\n0:52:30 - The effect of grand multiparity (having 5+ children) on cardiovascular disease risk for women\n0:55:00 - The impact of oral contraceptives on cardiovascular disease risk\n0:58:45 - The effect of pregnancy on lipids & other metabolic parameters\n1:02:00 - The undertreatment of women with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) & how it increases lifetime risk of ASCVD\n1:09:45 - How concerns around statins have contributed to undertreatment, & whether women should stop statins during pregnancy\n1:16:00 - How Erin approaches the prescription of statins to patients\n1:21:15 - PCSK9 inhibitors & other non-statin drugs\n1:28:30 - Advice for the low- and high-risk individual\n1:31:00 - The impact of nutrition, stress, & lifestyle on lipids & CVD risk\n1:41:15 - Lp(a) as a risk enhancer for cardiovascular disease\n1:50:30 - The effect of menopause on cardiovascular disease risk\n1:55:30 - How Erin approaches decisions regarding hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for her patients\n2:03:30 - The urgent need for more data on women\u2019s health\n2:09:45 - Erin\u2019s goal of running a marathon in every state\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Peter highlights the importance of understanding cardiovascular disease and why early intervention is critical. He also provides a primer on lipoproteins and explains the fallacy of the terms \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d and \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d Allan Sniderman discusses the metrics measured in routine blood work \u2013 along with the limitations of those standard panels \u2013 before explaining why apoB is a superior metric for determining risk. Additionally, Tom Dayspring explains the casual role of apoB in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and the therapeutic goals for apoB concentration, and Peter explains how early and aggressive lowering of apoB could change the landscape of cardiovascular disease prevention.\n\n\nWe discuss:\n-Intro [0:00]\n-The importance of understanding atherosclerosis early in life [2:25];\n-Defining ASCVD, its causes, and the role of cholesterol [8:00];\n-Why early prevention of atherosclerosis is critical [13:45];\n-Preventing atherosclerosis\u2014two fatal flaws with the \u201c10-Year Risk\u201d approach [16:00];\n-Intro to lipids and lipoproteins: why there is no \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol [23:00];\n-Limitations of standard blood panels [35:45]; \n-How Mendelian randomization is bolstering the case for apoB as the superior metric for risk prediction [39:30];\n-Therapeutic goals for apoB concentration [58:15];\n-How early and aggressive lowering of apoB could change the course of ASCVD [1:10:45]; and\n-More.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

He has spent the past 40 years investigating the role of dietary protein in muscle protein synthesis. In this episode, Don describes how his decades of research have shaped his thinking around protein, muscle, anabolic factors, metabolism, and more. He explains the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein: what it is, how it came about, and how it should serve only as a guide for the minimum protein necessary for survival rather than as an optimal level of protein intake. He provides an overview of the essential amino acids, explains the nuances of animal versus plant protein, and provides insights for determining protein quality, absorption rates, and how to best track your intake. He discusses the ideal timing of protein intake in relation to resistance exercise, how protein should be distributed among meals, and how limitations in protein utilization per sitting can impact those practicing time-restricted eating. Additionally, Don shares results from his clinical trials, including how a high-protein diet fared in terms of fat loss, and explains the differences in protein utilization between adolescents and adults and how the problem of reduced efficiency of protein utilization in older adults can be overcome.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Don\u2019s background: from growing up on a farm to studying nutritional biochemistry\n0:04:39 - Don\u2019s philosophy on nutrition, muscle, and metabolism\n0:18:10 - The controversial relationship between saturated fat and atherosclerosis\n0:26:30 - The basics of protein and amino acids\n0:33:46 - Origin and limitations of the current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein intake\n0:43:44 - Protein sources: determining quality, absorption rates, and how to track intake\n0:51:35 - Leucine, lysine, and methionine: three important essential amino acids\n0:57:35 - The vital role of ruminant animals in the production of quality protein\n1:04:55 - The differing needs and impacts of dietary protein for a 16-year old compared to a 65-year old\n1:12:50 - Consequences of protein deficiency in childhood\n1:19:50 - Muscle protein synthesis: ideal timing, small meals vs. big meals, and more\n1:27:51 - Protein needs of children\n1:33:07 - How important is timing protein intake around training?\n1:37:27 - The role of leucine in fatty acid oxidation by muscle\n1:41:07 - High protein diets for fat loss: Results from Don\u2019s clinical trials\n1:55:24 - Influence of industry funding on nutrition studies\n2:01:26 - Don\u2019s thoughts on plant-based and synthetic \u201cmeats\u201d\n2:10:05 - Problems with epidemiological studies of dietary protein\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Matt explains his research findings on nutrition as it relates to aging and longevity, including the results from his recent review article in Science. From there, he and Peter dive deep into the literature on calorie restriction (CR), explaining the nuance, benefits for lifespan and healthspan, and potential downsides of CR. He discusses the epigenetic changes that occur with age and potential benefits and downsides of epigenetic reprogramming, often viewed as a panacea for reversing aging. Matt also explains the impact of dietary protein on aging, including the interesting dichotomy around how protein, a critical macronutrient, and rapamycin, a geroprotective molecule, have opposite effects on mTOR. Additionally, he talks about low-protein vs. high-protein diets and their effects on muscle mass and mortality, as well as the impact of IGF-1 signaling and growth hormone on lifespan.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Challenges with understanding the effects of nutrition and studying interventions for aging\n0:05:26 - How Peter\u2019s and Matt\u2019s convictions on nutrition and thoughts optimal health have evolved\n0:14:48 - Calorie restriction for improving lifespan in animal models\n0:21:05 - Utility of epigenetic clocks and possibility of epigenetic reprogramming\n0:32:09 - Mutations and changes to the epigenome with aging\n0:36:21 - Epigenetic reprogramming: potential benefits and downsides and whether it can work in every organ/tissue\n0:44:43 - First potential applications of anti-aging therapies and tips for for aging well\n0:49:40 - Impact of calorie restriction on the immune system, muscle mass, and strength\n0:59:34 - Insights from famous calorie restriction studies in rhesus macaques\n1:09:18 - An evolutionary perspective of the human diet\n1:19:10 - Antiaging diets: Separating fact from fiction\u2014Matt\u2019s 2021 review in Science\n1:27:39 - Mouse models of time-restricted feeding in the context of calorie restriction\n1:36:38 - Nutritional interventions that consistently impact lifespan in mice, and concerns around efficacy in humans\n1:41:46 - Differing impact of calorie restriction when started later in life\n1:49:02 - Lifespan extension with rapamycin in older mice\n1:55:38 - Relationship between protein intake and aging, and mouse studies showing protein restriction can extend lifespan\n2:04:07 - Impact of protein intake on mTOR, and why inhibition of mTOR doesn\u2019t cause muscle loss\n2:09:37 - Low-protein vs. high-protein diets and their effects on muscle mass, mortality, and more\n2:22:16 - The impact of IGF-1 signaling and growth hormone on lifespan\n2:37:23 - Parting thoughts on the contribution of nutrition to healthspan and lifespan\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

This episode focuses on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a skills-based technique which was originally developed to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD) & has since been adapted to treat depression & other mental health conditions, as well as to help people who have difficulty with emotional regulation & self-destructive behaviors. Shireen explains the origins of DBT & how its creator, Dr. Marsha Linehan, came to find a need for something beyond cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) when attempting to treat patients with suicidal behavior. From there, Shireen dives into how DBT works to resolve the apparent contradiction between self-acceptance & change to bring about positive changes in emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, mindfulness, distress tolerance, & more. She also provides examples for how one can apply specific skills taught with DBT such as accessing the \u201cwise mind,\u201d applying radical acceptance, using the \u201cDEAR MAN\u201d technique, & utilizing an emotion regulation skill called \u201copposite action.\u201d Finally, she explains how the tenets of DBT offer benefits to anyone, & she provides insights & resources for people wanting to further explore DBT.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro \n0:00:08 - The basics of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) & how it differs from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\n0:06:15 - Treating depression with CBT: history, effectiveness, & how it laid the groundwork for DBT\n0:15:22 - Marsha Linehan\u2019s inspiration for developing DBT\n0:20:10 - Explaining borderline personality disorder (and associated conditions) through the lens of DBT\n0:38:15 - How work with suicidal patients led to the development of DBT\u2014a dialectic between change and acceptance\n0:49:04 - Details of DBT: defining the term \u201cdialectical\u201d and how to access the \u201cwise mind\u201d\n0:56:29 - Practicing mindfulness and radical acceptance in the context of DBT\n1:09:50 - Applying \u201cradical acceptance\u201d to tragic scenarios  \n1:16:15 - The five domains of skills taught in DBT\n1:23:30 - Why Marsha chose borderline personality disorder as her focus when developing DBT \n1:26:15 - Is there any benefit in doing DBT for someone without a pathological condition?\n1:31:50 - The DEAR MAN skill of DBT\n1:44:44 - Adapting DBT skills for adolescents and families \n1:47:55 - Identifying vulnerability factors, increasing distress tolerance, and the impact of physical pain\n2:01:19 - The DBT chain analysis: assessing problem behaviors and identifying vulnerability factors\n2:08:15 - Why the regulation of emotions can be so challenging\n2:11:58 - The importance of mindfulness skills in DBT\n2:16:15 - Opposite action: an emotion regulation skill\n2:23:42 - Advice for those wanting to explore DBT\n2:29:13 - Finding a well-trained DBT therapist\n\n---\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

While Peter maintains that exercise is perhaps the single most important tool we have to live longer and live better, he explains the challenges involved in identifying an optimal dose. He takes a hard look at studies\u2014many of which have contradictory results\u2014to highlight major limitations in methodology and how readers could be misled. Additionally, he discusses the rare, but real, risks associated with extreme levels of physical activity and concludes by weighing the benefits against the risks of exercise.\n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:08 - How exercise reduces risk for all-cause mortality\n06:15 - Defining the metric called \u201cMET\u201d and how it\u2019s useful for evaluating different exercises\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-The challenge in determining the optimal dose of exercise and the limitations of methods used to study the effect of exercise;\n-Using VO2 max as a proxy for fitness to better predict mortality risk;\n-Reviewing data which support the theory of a \u201cJ-curve\u201d relationship between exercise and longevity;\n-Importance of understanding p-values and statistical significance;\n-Deconstructing the studies that show a J-curve: major limitations and how one could be misled;\n-Peter\u2019s takeaways on the theoretical \u201cJ-curve\u201d relationship between exercise and longevity;\n-Risk of sudden cardiac death from vigorous physical exertion;\n-Atrial fibrillation associated with extreme levels of exercise;\n-Parting thoughts: benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks;\n-More.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Josh focuses the discussion on three main topics: metabolomics, NAD (and its precursors), and cancer metabolism. The metabolomics discussion starts with a broad definition of metabolism, metabolites, and fluxomics before diving deep into glucose metabolism, lactate as a fuel, movement of lactate, and the regulation of these substrates. He then gives a detailed explanation of the electron transport chain and Krebs cycle and their implications with respect to both drugs and nutrition while also explaining how NAD is central to the process of energy generation. He then discusses the age-related decline in NAD and what current literature says about efforts to increase NAD through intravenous or oral supplementation with the precursors NMN and NR, including whether doing so provides any advantage to lifespan or healthspan. Finally, Josh ends the conversation talking about cancer metabolism and how one particular intersection between cancer metabolism and immunotherapy might provide a hopeful outlook on the future of cancer treatment.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Josh\u2019s background and unique path to becoming a research scientist at Princeton\n0:09:11 - What sparked Josh\u2019s early interest in metabolism\n0:14:59 - Metabolomics 101: defining metabolites and how they are regulated\n0:25:42 - Fluxomics: Metabolism as a system in action\n0:34:43 - The Randle Hypothesis: glucose and fatty acids compete as substrates for oxidation\n0:37:44 - The important role of lactate as an alternate fuel\n0:50:09 - Fasting lactate levels as a potential early indicator of metabolic dysfunction\n0:57:17 - The beauty of the Krebs cycle and the role of NAD in energy production\n1:10:46 - How the drug metformin acts on complex I of the electron transport chain\n1:15:30 - The difference between NADH and NADPH\n1:17:45 - NAD levels with age, and the efficacy of supplementing with intravenous NAD\n1:31:44 - The usefulness of restoring NAD levels and efficacy of oral supplementation with NAD precursors NR and NMN\n1:43:59 - Exploring the hypothesis that boosting NAD levels is beneficial\n1:51:25 - Cancer metabolism and the intersection with immunotherapy\n2:00:17 - Making cancer a chronic disease: exploiting the metabolic quirks of cancer, augmenting the immune system, and more\n2:05:06 - The challenge of treating pancreatic cancer\n2:12:07 - Epithelial cancers that might respond to metabolic approaches to therapy\n2:14:50 - Josh\u2019s hopeful outlook on the future of cancer treatment\n2:16:39 - Nutritional approaches to cancer attenuation\n2:23:26 - What makes Princeton University special\n-------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Mike gives a tour de force on the pathways of gut-brain communication but first sets the stage with an overview of gastrointestinal tract development and anatomy. He then explains how the gut communicates with the brain and vice versa, from early observations in physiology and anatomy up to our present understanding of what makes the GI tract so unique and complex relative to other organs. He talks about how the gut responds to meals of different food qualities and how that affects satiety signaling to the brain. Additionally, he explains how antidepressants and other drugs impact digestion through effects on serotonin signaling, and he discusses the effects of antibiotics, and what\u2019s really going on with \u201cleaky gut.\u201d Finally, Mike offers his thoughts on the utility\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of gut microbiome diagnostic tests, and wraps up the discussion by considering how diet, probiotics, and prebiotics impact the microbiome and GI tract.\n\nWe discuss:\n-Intro [0:00]\n-The basics of the gastrointestinal (GI) system [3:45];\n-The very early development of the GI system [9:30];\n-The unique properties of the blood supply and portal system in the GI tract [12:45];\n-An overview of gut anatomy and innervation [16:30];\n-Turnover of the epithelial lining and why cancer rarely develops in the small intestine [26:45];\n-Nutrient and water absorption in the small and large intestine [30:30];\n-Ways in which the gut and brain communicate [34:30];\n-The gut's role in the regulation of appetite [43:30];\n-The impact of gastric bypass surgery on satiety signals [51:15];\n-How varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can infect neurons in the gut and create issues later in life [54:30];\n-The relationship between autism and gastrointestinal illness [1:02:45];\n-The important role of serotonin in the gut, and the impact of SSRIs on serotonin in the gut [1:09:45];\n-Defining \u201cleaky gut\u201d and its most common causes [1:16:45];\n-The gut microbiome [1:30:45];\n-Fecal transplants: use cases, limitations, and how they illustrate the importance of gut microbes [1:40:45];\n-Gut microbiome diagnostic tests: why they aren\u2019t useful outside of special cases such as cancer detection [1:50:30];\n-Nutritional approaches to a maintain optimal flora in the gut [1:55:00];\n-Prebiotics and probiotics, and getting your GI system back on track after a course of antibiotics [2:02:30]; and \n-More.\n\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

He begins with an overview of bone mineral density, how it's measured, how it changes over the course of life, and the variability between sexes largely due to changes in estrogen levels. From there he provides insights into ways that one can improve bone health, from exercise to nutrition supplements to drugs. Additionally, Peter discusses what happens when one may be forced to be sedentary (e.g., bedrest) and how you can work to minimize the damage during these periods.\n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00 - intro\n00:08 - Overview of bone health topics to be discussed\n04:15 - Bones 101: bone function, structure, and more\n08:26 - Bone mineral density (BMD), minerals in bone, role of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and more\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-The consequences of poor bone health;\n-The devastating nature of hip fractures: morbidity and mortality data\n-Where fractures tend to occur in the body;\n-Defining osteopenia and osteoporosis;\n-Measuring BMD with DEXA and how to interpret scores;\n-Variability in BMD between sexes;\n-When should people have their first bone mineral density scan?;\n-How BMD changes throughout the life and how it differs between men and women;\n-How changes in estrogen levels (e.g., menopause) impacts bone health;\n-Why HRT is not considered a standard of care for postmenopausal bone loss;\n-Factors determining who may be at higher risk of poor bone health;\n-Common drugs that can negatively impact BMD;\n-How children can optimize bone health and lay the foundation for the future;\n-Types of physical activity that can positively impact bone health;\n-How weight loss can negatively impact bone health and how exercise can counteract those effects;\n-Nutrition and supplements for bone health;\n-Pharmaceutical drugs prescribed for those with low BMD;\n-Impact of extreme sedentary periods (e.g., bedrest) and how to minimize their damage to bone; and\n-More.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

Max\u2019s research focuses on developing novel methods for detecting circulating tumor DNA in the blood of cancer patients and on elucidating the molecular pathways and genes associated with cancer. His interests also include uncovering biomarkers that can predict patient survival, responses to therapy, and disease recurrence. In this packed episode, Max discusses the history of blood-based cancer screening and the importance of understanding the predictive value of tests\u2014sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value \u2013 and how these metrics play into cancer screening. Max then goes in depth on the topic of liquid biopsies, including the history, current landscape, and possible future of liquid biopsies as a cancer detection tool. He discusses how these non-invasive blood tests can detect DNA/RNA from tumor cells released into the blood as well as the different methods one can use to predict if a cancer is present. He gets granular on the topic of cell-free DNA/RNA signature, methylation patterns, and the importance of knowing mutation information, and he ends with a discussion on the exciting future of liquid biopsies and how we can possibly get to the panacea of cancer screening.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Max\u2019s training that planted the seeds for development of liquid biopsies\n0:08:45 - Max\u2019s decision to specialize in radiation oncology\n0:16:00 - A culture at Stanford that values research and physician scientists\n0:18:50 - The motivation to develop liquid biopsies\n0:26:47 - History of blood-based cancer screening and understanding the predictive value of tests\n0:34:49 - Current state of lung cancer and the need for better screening\n0:46:46 - Low-dose CT scans: an important tool for managing lung cancer but with limitations\n0:53:21 - Using liquid biopsies to identify circulating tumor cells\n1:12:25 - Liquid biopsy research moves from circulating tumor cells to cell-free DNA\n1:21:41 - Zeroing-in on circulating tumor DNA in cell-free DNA\n1:34:59 - Cell-free RNA and Max\u2019s vision for cancer detection from a blood sample\n1:37:41 - Methylation patterns and other informative signatures found in DNA\n1:40:15 - Mutation-based methods of liquid biopsies\n1:45:27 - Understanding the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test\n1:53:57 - Existing clinical liquid biopsy tests and their limitations\n2:01:22 - The future of liquid biopsies\n2:10:48 - How we get to the panacea of cancer screening\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Stephan explains how obesity has changed phenotypically over the course of human history as well as what might explain the dramatic increase in prevalence of obesity in the last few decades. He talks in depth about the role of genetics, the brain, and hormones like leptin play in the regulation of fat mass. He dives deep into two common theories of obesity\u2014the carbohydrate-insulin model and the energy balance model and provides his take on which theory has stronger evidence. Additionally, he provides insights on how we\u2019re hard-wired to think about food and the consequences of modern foods designed for maximal pleasure. Finally, he goes through the factors that affect body weight, set points, and provides takeaways for people wanting to take advantage of what we know about the brain\u2019s role in regulating our body weight.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Stephan\u2019s neuroscience background and his focus on the nuances of obesity\n0:07:17 - How obesity has changed for humans throughout history\n0:14:45 - The association between obesity and adverse health outcomes, the \u201cobesity paradox,\u201d and confounders when relating BMI to longevity\n0:25:49 - The sharp increase in obesity across demographics\n0:33:52 - The hypothalamus and its role in obesity\n0:45:32 - The role of the hormone leptin in obesity\n0:53:24 - The genetic component of obesity\n1:05:48 - Understanding the tendency of humans to store fat through an evolutionary lens\n1:13:32 - The hedonic aspect of food, and how the brain reacts to modern, highly-rewarding foods\n1:26:46 - How we are hard-wired to think about food\n1:35:16 - A review of the \u201cCarnivore diet\u201d\n1:50:06 - The energy balance model, carbohydrate-insulin model, and unifying the theories around adiposity\n1:58:41 - Body weight set points: a hypothetical comparison of two individuals\n2:07:26 - Takeaways for people who want to lose weight and keep it off\n2:16:34 - Evidence that favors the energy balance model of weight gain\n2:26:54 - The synergistic effect of fat and carbohydrates and observations that a low-fat diet or a low-carb diet can cause weight loss\n2:34:46 - Red Pen Reviews\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Marty dives deep into the topic of patient safety. He describes the risk of medical errors that patients face when they walk into the hospital and how those errors take place, and he highlights what amounts to an epidemic of medical mistakes. He explains how the culture of patient safety has advanced in recent decades, the specific improvements driven by a patient safety movement, and what\u2019s holding back further progress. The second half of this episode discusses the high-profile case of RaDonda Vaught, a nurse at Vanderbilt Hospital convicted of negligent homicide after she mistakenly gave a patient the wrong medication in 2017. He discusses the fallout from this case and how it has in some ways unraveled decades of progress in patient safety. Furthermore, Marty provides insights in how to advocate for a loved one in the hospital, details the changes needed to meaningfully reduce the death rate from medical errors, and provides a hopeful vision for future improvements to patient safety.\n\nWe discuss:\n-Intro [0:00:00]\n-Brief history of patient safety, preventable medical mistakes, and catalysts for major changes to patient safety protocols [3:00];\n-Advancements in patient safety and the dramatic reduction in central line infections [16:45];\n-A surgical safety checklist\u2014a major milestone in patient safety [26:00];\n-A tragic case stimulates a culture of speaking up about concerns among surgical teams [28:00];\n-Studies showing the ubiquitous nature of medical mistakes leading to patient death [32:30];\n-The medical mistake of over-prescribing of opioids [36:30];\n-Other types of errors\u2014electronic medical records, nosocomial infections, and more [38:00];\n-Importance of honesty from physicians and what really drives malpractice claims [43:15];\n-A high-profile medical mistake case involving nurse RaDonda Vaught [50:15];\n-Investigations leading to the arrest of RaDonda Vaught [1:02:30];\n-Vaught\u2019s trial\u2014a charge of \u201cnegligent homicide\u201d [1:08:00];\n-A guilty charge and an outpouring of support for Vaught [1:15:00]; \n-Concerns from the nursing profession over the RaDonda Vaught conviction [1:21:00];\n-How to advocate for a friend or family member in the hospital [1:23:15];\n-Changes needed for meaningful reduction in the death rate from medical errors [1:29:30];\n-Blind spots in our current national funding mechanism and the need for more research into patient safety [1:34:30];\n-Parting thoughts\u2014where do we go from here?

Together they answer many questions around the field of aging with an emphasis on three specific molecules\u2014NAD, metformin, and rapamycin\u2014and their purported geroprotective qualities. They first discuss aging biomarkers and epigenetic clocks before breaking down the advantages and limitations of the most common experimental models being used today to study aging and pharmacological possibilities for extending lifespan. Next they dive deep into NAD and the much-hyped NAD precursors, nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). They compare data from NAD precursors to studies on metformin and rapamycin, assessing how they stack up against each other and using the comparison as an opportunity to illustrate how to make sense of new experimental data and make smart decisions about how to approach future research.\n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00 - Logic behind comparing NAD precursors to rapamycin and metformin;\n03:49 - Aging biomarkers: current state, usefulness, and future promise;\n12:37 - Epigenetic clocks: definition, use case, and limitations;\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n- Advantages and limitations of studying aging in non-humans and the strengths and weaknesses of different model systems;\n-  Aging studies: importance of control lifespans and the problems with reproducibility;\n- Intro to NAD, potential role in aging, relationship to sirtuins, and more;\n- NAD precursors (NR and NMN): current data;\n- Human studies with NAD precursors;\n- Comparing NAD lifespan data to data from metformin and rapamycin;\n- Defining a \u201cclean drug\u201d and a \u201cdirty drug\u201d;\n- Reason for the lack of rapamycin studies in humans compared to NAD and metformin;\n- Ranking the geroprotective molecules in terms of risk and reward; and\n- More.\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Peter discusses his framework for exercise, what he\u2019s really optimizing for, and how to train today to be prepared for a good life at age 100. He describes the importance of strength and stability, and why deadlifting is an important tool to consider for longevity. Additionally, he details why training in zone 2 and zone 5 is important, gives a primer on VO2 max, and describes the most effective ways to engage in those types of exercise. Finally, Peter reveals his current exercise routine.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:03:00 - What is Peter optimizing for with his exercise?\n0:06:10 - Preparing for a good life at age 100: Training for the \u201cCentenarian Olympics\u201d\n0:21:48 - The importance of preserving strength and muscle mass as we age\n0:27:39 - The value of deadlifts for stability and longevity when done properly\n0:35:44 - The importance of zone 2 aerobic training\n0:40:00 - The most effective ways to engage in zone 2 exercise\n0:44:21 - Zone 5 training and VO2 max\n0:51:58 - A primer on VO2 max\n1:03:09 - Stability\u2014the cornerstone upon which all exercise and movement relies\n1:07:55 - Peter\u2019s current exercise routine\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In the first half of this episode, Layne dives deep into the topic of energy balance, including the role that macronutrients and calories play in weight loss. He describes how many people struggle with tracking food and calories on their own across a variety of diets and how all of this can impact nutritional habits and behaviors. In the second half of the episode, Layne discusses the importance of protein and weightlifting for improving one\u2019s body composition and increasing muscle mass. He explains how he would prescribe different training and nutrition programs for two hypothetical clients\u2014a 50-year-old female who is entering menopause and wants to improve her health, and a 40-to-50-year-old male who wants to maximize muscle mass. Additionally, Layne discusses a number of supplements that could potentially benefit a training program including whey protein, branch chain amino acids, creatine, nitric oxide boosters, and more.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Defining energy balance and the role of calories\n0:06:16 - Defining a calorie, whether they are all created equal, and how much energy you can extract from the food you eat\n0:10:57 - Factors influencing total daily energy expenditure\n0:23:45 - The challenge of tracking energy expenditure accurately, and the thermic effect of different macronutrients\n0:36:39 - Challenges of sustained weight loss: metabolic adaptation, set points, and more\n0:43:00 - Weight loss strategies: tracking calories, cheat meals, snacks, fasting, exercise, and more\n0:56:28 - Sitting in discomfort, focusing on habits, and other lessons Layne learned as a natural bodybuilder\n1:07:07 - Commonalities in people who maintain long-term weight-loss\n1:09:25 - Does a ketogenic diet result in greater energy expenditure?\n1:22:23 - The metabolic benefits of exercise, muscle mass, and protein intake\n1:28:17 - The impact of lean muscle and strength on lifespan and healthspan\n1:37:03 - Hypothetical case study #1: Training program for 50-year-old female\n1:41:07 - Muscle protein synthesis in a trained athlete vs. untrained individual following a resistance training program\n1:47:50 - Protein and amino acids needed to build and maintain muscle mass\n1:54:00 - Nutrition plan for the hypothetical 50-year-old woman starting a program to build lean muscle\n2:08:53 - Dispelling myths that excess protein intake increases cancer risk through elevations in mTOR and IGF\n2:18:39 - Hypothetical case study #2: Training program for a 50-year-old, trained male wanting to increase muscle mass\n2:27:20 - Maximizing hypertrophy while minimizing fatigue\u2014is it necessary to train to muscular failure?\n2:32:38 - Ideal sets and reps for the hypothetical 50-year-old male interested in hypertrophy\n2:39:34 - Maximizing hypertrophy by working a muscle at a long muscle length\n2:41:08 - Recommended lower body exercise routines and tips about training frequency\n2:47:26 - Nutrition plan for the hypothetical 50-year old male wanting to add muscle\n2:52:42 - Cycling weight gain and weight loss when building lean muscle mass, and expectations for progress over time\n2:58:17 - Supplements to aid in hypertrophy training\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Nir divulges insights into lifespan and healthspan through the lens of his extensive research on centenarians as well as the latest from the TAME trial (Targeting/Taming Aging with Metformin), a multi-center study investigating the concept that the multi-morbidities of aging can be delayed in humans. He discusses common gene variants found in centenarians, important pathways for longevity, and ultimately what we can learn from centenarians about extending lifespan while also trying to improve healthspan. Additionally, Nir goes into depth on metformin as a longevity tool for humans, including studies with positive and negative results. He discusses the impact metformin can have on exercise for both strength training and cardiovascular training, as well as future research facilitated by data from the TAME Trial. He also touches on epigenetic clocks and concludes with his take on the usefulness of NAD precursors as a potential gero-protective agent.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:08 - Insights from genetic studies of centenarians and twins\n0:11:13 - Genes with protective variants that aid longevity\n0:22:23 - The relationship between growth hormone and IGF-1\n0:35:37 - Use of growth hormone as a longevity tool\n0:44:29 - Longevity genotypes: the role of APOE e2, Lp(a), Klotho, and CETP\n0:50:04 - The correlation between high TSH and longevity\n0:56:30 - Important pathways for longevity\n1:04:38 - Insights from centenarian studies, nature vs. nurture, and more\n1:14:56 - The contraction of morbidity that comes with improved healthspan\n1:20:56 - Defining healthspan\n1:26:14 - Unique perspectives and positive attitudes of centenarians\n1:33:32 - Lessons to take away from centenarians\n1:38:48 - Metformin overview: history, studies, and potential for gero-protection\n1:50:07 - The TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin)\n1:59:29 - The challenge of studying metformin in animals models\n2:07:27 - How data from the TAME trial could provide insights into biomarkers of aging and facilitate a future study on proteomics\n2:14:54 - The search for biomarkers to identify who can benefit from treatment\n2:26:29 - The impact of metformin on exercise, and finding the right indication for the use of metformin\n2:39:36 - Are NAD precursors geroprotective?\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

Peter argues for the importance of paying attention to and understanding ASCVD given its ubiquity and inevitability. He goes into great detail about the development of atherosclerosis and how it can take hold at a very early age, the role of cholesterol, and the causal factors of ASCVD that determine prevention strategies. Additionally, he discusses the important metrics and biomarkers found in blood work, as well as diagnostic tests such as coronary artery calcium scores (CAC) and CT angiograms which help to determine the level of arterial damage present. Finally, Peter lays out the keys to understanding and interpreting calcium scores before wrapping up the conversation with his key takeaways regarding prevention.\n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - The importance of understanding atherosclerosis early in life\n07:52 - Defining atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), its causes, and the role of cholesterol\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-The process of developing ASCVD, part 1\n-The process of developing ASCVD, part 2\n-The process of developing ASCVD, part 3\n-How early in life ASCVD can start to develop\n-Case studies of atherosclerosis and figures showing real pathology\n-Coronary artery lesions present in autopsies of different age groups\n-The causal factors of ASCVD that determine prevention strategies\n-Labs to identify biomarkers of ASCVD\n-Diagnostic tests to determine the level of arterial damage present\u2014CAC, CTA, CIMT, and more\n-Calcium scores: keys to understanding and interpreting a CAC score and/or CTA results\n-Is there a risk from cholesterol levels being too low?\n-Key takeaways regarding prevention\n-More.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

We must have the ability to shift weight, accelerate and decelerate our mass through different parts of the feet in order to respond and stabilize appropriately to changes in our environment.\n \nWhile I love to play with a balance board, it doesn\u2019t really help me gain the \u201cfeels\u201d with my feet that the Black Board tool provides. I have to use my foot and lower leg to respond to how my weight shifts up top.\n\n----\n\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

His research and clinical work focuses on exercise-related metabolism, metabolic health, diabetes, cancer metabolism, nutrition, sports performance, and critical care. In this episode, I\u00f1igo describes how his work with Tour de France winner Tadej Poga\u010dar has provided insights into the amazing potential of elite athletes from a performance and metabolic perspective. He speaks specifically about lactate levels, fat oxidation, how carbohydrates in food can affect our lactate and how equal lactate outputs between an athlete and a metabolically unhealthy individual can mean different things. Next, he discusses how Zone 2 training boosts mitochondrial function and impacts longevity. He explains the different metrics for assessing one\u2019s Zone 2 threshold and describes the optimal dose, frequency, duration, and type of exercise for Zone 2. Additionally, he offers his thoughts on how to incorporate high intensity training (Zone 5) to optimize health, as well as the potential of metformin and NAD to boost mitochondrial health. Finally, he discusses insights he\u2019s gathered from studying the mitochondria of long COVID patients in the ICU.\n\nWe discuss:\n0:00:00 - Intro\n0:00:10 - The amazing potential of cyclist Tadej Poga\u010dar\n0:06:54 - Metrics for assessing athletic performance in cyclists and how that impacts race strategy\n0:17:20 - The impact of performance-enhancing drugs and the potential for transparency into athletes\u2019 data during competition\n0:26:06 - Tadej Poga\u010dar\u2019s race strategy and mindset at the Tour de France\n0:29:58 - Defining Zone 2, fat oxidation, and how they are measured\n0:40:04 - Using fat and carbohydrate utilization to calculate the mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility\n0:44:30 - Lactate levels and fat oxidation as it relates to Zone 2 exercise\n0:59:54 - How moderately active individuals should train to improve metabolic function and maximize mitochondrial performance\n1:06:27 - Bioenergetics of the cell and what is different in elite athletes\n1:19:19 - How the level of carbohydrate in the diet and ketogenic diets affects fuel utilization and power output during exercise\n1:27:27 - Glutamine as a source for making glycogen\u2014insights from studying the altered metabolism of ICU patients\n1:34:27 - How exercise mobilizes glucose transporters\u2014an important factor in diabetic patients\n1:39:00 - Metrics for finding Zone 2 threshold\u2014lactate, heart rate, and more\n1:58:27 - Optimal Zone 2 training: dose, frequency, duration, and type of exercise\n2:10:22 - How to incorporate high intensity training (Zone 5) to increase VO2 max and optimize fitness\n2:23:25 - Compounding benefits of Zone 2 exercise and how we can improve metabolic health into old age\n2:27:57 - The effects of metformin, NAD, and supplements on mitochondrial function\n2:37:45 - The role of lactate and exercise in cancer\n2:44:42 - How assessing metabolic parameters in long COVID patients provides insights into this disease\n2:52:57 - The advantages of using cellular surrogates of metabolism instead of VO2 max for prescribing exercise\n3:02:30 - Metabolomics reveals how cellular metabolism is altered in sedentary individuals\n3:08:49 - Cellular changes in the metabolism of people with diabetes and metabolic syndrome\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

Currently the Dean of the Indiana University School of Public Health, he has also authored many publications on statistical and research methodology and how to improve research rigor and integrity. David\u2019s focus on evidence and data brings forth an interesting discussion of what we know (and don\u2019t know) about the science of obesity. He provides an insightful and unemotional explanation of the potential impact of nutritional epidemiology in public health while also explaining its many pitfalls and limitations. He offers his take on the path forward in addressing the obesity epidemic, and he closes with a lucid explanation for the evident lack of credibility in science and the steps we can take to change that.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - David\u2019s background, interest in obesity, and focus on evidence\n00:08:44 - The moment when the obesity crisis was recognized, and the sloppy science that ensued\n00:17:11 - What twins studies tell us about the genetics of obesity\n00:20:36 - How doctors and scientists have historically approached obesity treatment\n00:28:45 - Do surgical procedures for obesity prolong life?\n00:34:08 - The \u2018Obesity Paradox\u2019\n00:41:48 - Interpreting BMI and mortality data and considering confounders\n00:49:54 - How body composition and ethnicity factor into consideration of BMI data\n00:57:12 - Superior tools for measuring obesity at the individual level\n01:02:31 - Using BMI data for actionable steps to combat obesity\n01:06:55 - Why maintaining weight loss is more challenging than losing weight\n01:18:44 - Differing perspectives on the utility of nutritional epidemiology\n01:25:08 - A mouse study illustrating the impossibility of fully controlling for confounds in observational studies\n01:29:59 - Limitations of nutritional epidemiology and how it can improve\n01:42:06 - Addressing the obesity epidemic\u2014the path forward and obstacles to overcome\n01:53:28 - What David believes to be the most promising interventions we could take to address obesity and improve public health\n01:57:45 - Reproducibility in science, normative and non-normative errors explained\n02:05:27 - Rebuilding trust in science and differentiating between science and advocacy\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

He walks through the mechanics and fundamentals of some of his favorite lifts including squats, deadlifts, and hip thrusters and stresses the relative importance of each in the context of longevity. He touches on the relative importance of muscle size vs. muscle strength and discusses the impact of fasting on muscle mass and the potential tradeoffs during aging. Peter then dives into the topic of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for both men and women, starting with a clinical discussion around how he actually replaces testosterone in patients. He explains the targets of this therapy as well as the risks and benefits, and he gives his interpretation of current data on the association between TRT and heart disease. \n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00 - intro\n00:10 - Peter\u2019s current exercise routine\n03:44 - How Peter incorporates blood flow restriction (BFR) into his workouts\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-Relative importance of muscle size vs. muscle strength;\n-Comparing squats to deadlifts and why both are important;\n-Squatting technique and fundamentals;\n-Important cues to look for while lifting weights;\n-Proper mechanics of a deadlift;\n-Hip thrusters as an alternative to the squat or deadlift;\n-Split-leg work for simulating activities of daily living;\n-The impact of fasting/calorie restriction on muscle mass and the potential tradeoffs to consider;\n-Testosterone replacement therapy: Considerations when contemplating TRT and Peter\u2019s approach with patents;\n-Data on the association between TRT and heart disease;\n-TRT for women\u2014risks and benefits;\nImpact of fasting on testosterone levels;\n-And more.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Rick explains how the body can generate fructose from glucose and how circulating glucose and salt levels can activate this conversion. He discusses the decline in metabolic flexibility associated with aging, as well as how factors such as sugar intake or menopause-associated hormone changes can alter responses to sugar across a lifetime. In addition, Rick lays out strategies for combating the development of metabolic illness using dietary changes and pharmaceutical therapies, and he discusses the impact of fructose metabolism and uric acid on kidney function and blood pressure. He concludes with a discussion of vasopressin, a hormone that facilitates fructose\u2019s effects on weight gain and insulin resistance.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Unique features of fructose metabolism and why it matters\n00:09:00 - A primer on fructose metabolism and uric acid\n00:21:04 - Endogenous fructose production, the polyol pathway, and the effect of non-fructose sugars\n00:28:20 - Findings from animal studies of glucose and fructose consumption\n00:45:06 - What calorie-controlled studies say about the claim that a \u201ccalorie is a calorie\u201d\n00:56:45 - Implications for aging and disease\n01:08:58 - Impact of endogenous fructose production on obesity and metabolic syndrome\n01:12:43 - Why vulnerability to the negative effects of sugar increases with age and menopause\n01:26:43 - Dietary strategies to reduce the negative impact of fructose \n01:43:56 - The role of hypertension in chronic disease and tips for lowering blood pressure\n01:54:16 - The impact of fructose and uric acid on kidney function and blood pressure\n02:04:50 - The potential role of sodium in hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome\n02:11:18 - The role of vasopressin in metabolic disease\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

Next, they dive deep into the topic of alcohol, beginning with a discussion on the negative impact that it can have on sleep. They then break down the confusing body of literature suggesting potential health benefits to moderate levels of drinking compared to complete abstinence and point out the limitations of these studies. Finally, they conclude by analyzing data on the impact of moderate and heavy drinking on the liver and on risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia.\n\nPlease note: this AMA is audio only.

Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD). Here, we address many of the listener questions we received about our original discussion. In addition to Marty and ZDoggMD, we are also joined by Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist and Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. In this episode, we talk about new data on Omicron, long COVID, masks, kids and schools, vaccine mandates, policy questions, and treatments. We also discuss some of the most prevalent misinformation and spend time talking about claims made by Robert Malone. We end with a conversation about our exit strategy.\n\nPlease note: we recorded this episode on January 17, 2022, and in an effort to get it out as soon as possible, this won\u2019t have full show notes or a video.

In the episode, Karl explains his unique career path that led to the development of optogenetics\u2014a revolutionary technique that uses specialized light-sensitive ion channels to precisely control the activity of select populations of neurons. Karl provides a concise overview of how optogenetics works and how it can be used to better understand mental illness, to identify the neurons responsible for specific behaviors, and to guide development of new treatments. Karl uses his experience as a practicing psychiatrist to provide deep insights into depression, anxiety, autism, and personality disorders and explains the role of optogenetics in mapping out brain regions responsible for common mental health afflictions. \n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Karl\u2019s journey through medical school and interest in the brain\n00:14:51 - A profound medical school experience that changed Karl\u2019s career path to psychiatry\n00:25:07 - Karl\u2019s commitment to research and challenges overcome early in his career\n00:32:43 - The state of psychiatry and mental health therapies when Karl started his lab in 2004\n00:38:13 - Neuroscience 101: fundamentals of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology\n00:48:05 - Traditional techniques for identifying the brain regions involved in specific behaviors\n00:52:30 - Intro to optogenetics and how to get a gene into a neuron\n01:04:50 - How viruses helped make optogenetics possible\n01:19:41 - How optogenetics was used to investigate the effects of dopamine neurons\n01:27:02 - Appreciating the power of optogenetics\n01:32:42 - Investigating and treating anxiety with optogenetics\n01:45:12 - Autism and autism-related anxiety, and the potential of optogenetics in treating autism\n01:52:41 - Optogenetics as a powerful tool for the discovery and creation of medical treatments\n01:55:59 - Karl\u2019s inspiration to write his book, Projections\n02:01:44 - Mania and bipolar disorder: evolutionary basis, symptoms, and the high prevalence in North America\n02:13:50 - Depression: evolutionary basis and insights from optogenetics\n02:31:03 - The effects of trauma early in life\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Paul explains how his personal experience with trauma and his many years seeing patients have shaped his understanding of trauma\u2019s impact on the brain, its common patterns and manifestations, and how often people don't recognize the implications of trauma in their own life. He discusses major challenges in recognizing trauma, including the lack of biomarkers in psychiatry and psychology, as well as the misguidance of the mental health system in targeting symptoms as opposed to root problems. He talks about shame as the biggest impediment to healing from trauma and offers solutions to how, as a society, we can start to change the stigma of mental health and allow more people to receive help. Finally, he concludes with a discussion about the potential role of psychedelics like psilocybin and MDMA in treating trauma.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Paul\u2019s background and unique path to psychiatry\n00:03:29 - A personal tragedy that shaped Paul\u2019s understanding of trauma and resulting feelings of shame and guilt\n00:19:42 - The current state of psychiatry training and need for improvement\n00:28:27 - The over-reliance on outdated metrics and lack of attention to past trauma as an impediment to patient care\n00:34:48 - Defining trauma: various types, heterogeneity, and effects on the brain\n00:47:55 - Importance of finding the roots of trauma and understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d\n00:56:49 - The major challenge of recognizing trauma in patients\n01:08:13 - How shame and guilt are barriers to treatment and healing\n01:14:18 - How treating trauma compares to treating an abscess\u2014a powerful analogy\n01:18:08 - How evolutionary survival instincts create problems in modern society\n01:22:00 - First step toward healing: overcoming the fear of talking about past trauma\n01:28:35 - Shame: the biggest impediment to healing\n01:37:57 - The antidote to shame and the need for discourse and understanding\n01:45:30 - The emotional health component of healthspan\n01:57:06 - How to reframe the conversation about mental health for a better future\n02:04:08 - The growing impact of trauma on our society and the need for compassion\n02:10:06 - Society\u2019s antiquated way of treating manifestations of trauma rather than root issues\n02:17:29 - Potential role of psychedelics like psilocybin and MDMA in treating trauma\n02:22:50 - Parting thoughts and resources for getting help\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD), both previous guests on The Drive. Marty is a Johns Hopkins professor and public health researcher and ZDoggMD is a UCSF Stanford trained internist and the founder of Turntable Health. This episode, recorded on December 27, 2021, was in part inspired by some of the shoddy science and even worse messaging coming from top officials regarding COVID-19. \n\nIn this discussion, Marty and ZDoggMD discuss what is known about the omicron variant, the risks and benefits of vaccines for all age groups, and the taboo subject of natural immunity and the protection it offers against infection and severe disease. Furthermore, they discuss at length the poor messaging coming from our public officials, the justification (and lack thereof) for certain mandates and policies in light of the current evidence, and the problems caused by the highly politicized and polarized nature of the subject. Themes throughout the conversation include the difference between science and advocacy, the messaging which is sowing mistrust in science despite major progress, and a search for what a possible \u201cend\u201d to this situation might look like. \n\nNOTE: Since this episode was recorded over the holiday and published ASAP, this is an audio-only episode with limited show notes.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:04:15 - Comparing omicron to delta and other mutations\n00:13:15 - Measuring immunity and protection from severe disease\u2014circulating antibodies, B cells, and T cells \n00:18:45 - Policy questions: what is the end game and how does the world go back to 2019?\n00:24:00 - A policy-minded framework for viewing COVID and the problem of groupthink\n00:39:00 - The difference between science and advocacy\n00:46:00 - Natural immunity from COVID after infection \n00:57:15 - The unfortunate erosion of trust in science despite impressive progress \n01:02:30 - Do the current mandates and policies make sense in light of existing data?\n01:18:15 - Risks associated with vaccines, and the risk of being labeled an anti-vaxxer when questioning them\n01:26:15 - Data on incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines \n01:35:00 - Outstanding questions about myocarditis as a side effect of mRNA vaccination and the benefit of boosters\n01:40:30 - The risk-reward of boosters and recommendations being ignored by policy makers in the US\n01:43:30 - Sowing distrust: Lack of honesty and humility from top officials and policy makers ;\n01:52:15 - Thoughts on testing: does it make sense to be pushing widespread testing for COVID?\n01:58:45 - What is the end point to all of this? \n02:05:30 - Downstream consequences of lockdowns and draconian policy measures \n02:10:30 - The polarized nature of COVID\u2014tribalism, skeptics, and demonization of ideas\n02:20:00 - Looking back at past pandemics for perspective and the potential for another pandemic in the future\n02:25:00 - What parents can do if their kids are subject to unreasonable policies\n02:28:45 - Voices of reason in this space\n02:32:15 - Strong convictions, loosely held: the value in questioning your own beliefs \n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

They define the various types of studies, how a study progresses from idea to execution, and how to identify study strengths and limitations. They explain how clinical trials work, as well as the potential for bias and common pitfalls to watch out for. They dig into key factors that contribute to the rigor (or lack thereof) of an experiment, and they discuss how to measure effect size, differentiate relative risk from absolute risk, and what it really means when a study is statistically significant. Finally, Peter lays out his personal process when reading through scientific papers.\n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00 - Intro\n00:10 - The ever changing landscape of scientific literature\n02:44 - The process for a study to progress from idea to design to execution\n06:39 - The various types of studies and how they differ\n20:22 - The different phases of a clinical trial\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-Observational studies and the potential for bias;\n-Experimental studies: Randomization, blinding, and other factors that make or break a study;\n-Power, p-values, and statistical significance;\n-Measuring effect size: Relative risk vs. absolute risk, hazard ratios, and \u201cNumber Needed to Treat\u201d;\n-How to interpret confidence intervals;\n-Why a study might be stopped before its completion;\n-Why only a fraction of studies are ever published and how to combat publication bias;\n-Why certain journals are more respected than others;\n-Peter\u2019s process when reading a scientific paper; and\nMore.\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Sam describes the fascinating life story of Otto Warburg, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who, despite being both Jewish and gay, survived Nazi Germany because of his valuable research on cellular metabolism and cancer. Sam describes Warburg\u2019s observation that cancer cells consume large amounts of glucose anaerobically \u2013 a phenomenon subsequently known as the \u201cWarburg Effect\u201d \u2013 and relates how Warburg\u2019s seminal work on this topic was largely forgotten after the discovery of oncogenes, only to regain relevance decades later within the field of cancer biology. Sam sheds light on the current debate around Warburg\u2019s interpretation of the causes of cancer, and Peter gives his personal take on the matter. Finally, Peter and Sam tie it all together with a discussion about cancer prevention, the role of hyperinsulinemia, and the link between dietary sugar and cancer.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Sam\u2019s interest in Otto Warburg and work as a writer [2:30];\n00:13:35 - Otto Warburg\u2019s dedication to science and his complicated life in Germany\n00:23:27 - Warburg\u2019s interest in cancer and early discoveries about cellular consumption of oxygen\n00:35:57 - The role models who fueled Warburg\u2019s desire to make a great discovery\n00:45:28 - How Warburg described the primary and secondary causes of cancer\n00:49:15 - Warburg\u2019s Nobel Prize in 1931\n00:50:05 - Warburg\u2019s life and work during WWII in Nazi Germany\n01:05:09 - Warburg\u2019s research in hydrogen transfers and coenzymes\u2014his best science?\n01:09:02 - Warburg\u2019s decision to stay in Germany after WWII\n01:13:34 - Discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s and the decline in interest in Warburg\u2019s ideas\n01:20:52 - The renaissance of Warburg\u2019s ideas on cancer metabolism and a new explanation for the Warburg Effect\n01:28:59 - The argument against the Warburg Effect as a primary cause of cancer and the potential role hyperinsulinemia\n01:35:33 - Identifying primary and secondary causes of cancer for the purpose of cancer prevention\n01:45:00 - The link between sugar, fructose, and cancer\n01:50:00 - Sam\u2019s reflections on the work that went into Ravenous\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Patrick tells the story of the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma - makers of the pain management drug OxyContin, providing the backdrop for the ensuing opioid epidemic and public health crisis.

In this episode, Allan explains the many risk factors used to predict atherosclerosis, including triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipoproteins, and he makes the case for apoB as a superior metric that is currently being underutilized. Allan expresses his frustration with the current scientific climate and its emphasis on consensus and unanimity over encouraging multiple viewpoints, thus holding back the advancement of metrics like apoB for assessing CVD risk, treatment, and prevention strategies. Finally, Allan illuminates his research that led to his 30-year causal model of risk and explains the potentially life-saving advantages of early intervention for the prevention of future disease.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Problems with the current 10-year risk assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the implications for prevention\n00:14:32 - A primer on cholesterol, apoB, and plasma lipoproteins\n00:22:07 - Pathophysiology of CVD and the impact of particle cholesterol concentration vs. number of particles\n00:28:45 - Limitations of standard blood panels\n00:33:10 - Remnant type III hyperlipoproteinemia\u2014high cholesterol, low Apo B, high triglyceride\n00:39:26 - Using apoB to estimate risk of CVD\n00:42:57 - How Mendelian randomization is bolstering the case for ApoB as the superior metric for risk prediction\n00:53:47 - Hypertension and CVD risk\n01:05:49 - Factors influencing the decision to begin preventative intervention for CVD\n01:11:37 - Using the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score as a predictive tool\n01:23:27 - The challenge of motivating individuals to take early interventions\n01:26:30 - How medical advancement is hindered by the lack of critical thinking once a \u201cconsensus\u201d is reached\n01:33:24 - PSK9 inhibitors and familial hypercholesterolemia: two examples of complex topics with differing interpretations of the science\n01:39:49 - Defining risk and uncertainty in the guidelines\n01:46:07 - Making clinical decisions in the face of uncertainty\n01:51:58 - How the emphasis on consensus and unanimity has become a crucial weakness for science and medicine\n01:59:58 - Factors holding back the advancement of apoB for assessing CVD risk, treatment, and prevention strategies\n02:11:44 - Advantages of a 30-year risk assessment and early intervention\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

His extensive research into human behavior has helped him identify key components of habit formation and develop the \u201cFour Laws of Behavioral Change.\u201d In this episode, James provides insights into how both good and bad habits are formed, including the influence of genetics, environment, social circles, and more. He points to changes one can make to cultivate more perseverance and discipline and describes the profound impact habits can have when tying them into one\u2019s self-identity.

His research focuses on illicit drugs\u2014their harm, classification, and potential for therapeutic use in psychiatry. In this episode, David discusses his framework for assessing the potential harm caused by common recreational drugs and explains how they are regulated, which is oftentimes misaligned with actual risk. He describes in detail the neurobiology, mechanisms of action, and addiction potential of alcohol, opiates, cocaine, and methamphetamine and contrasts those with psychedelics, which have been given a similar regulatory classification despite their relatively low risk of harm and their numerous potential therapeutic uses. Additionally, David explains the promise of psychedelics like ketamine, MDMA, and psilocybin for treating drug addiction and depression and discusses how political pressures have created roadblocks to future necessary research.\n \nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - intro\n00:00:10 - David\u2019s early interest in the brain and experience in psychiatry\n00:08:00 - David\u2019s brief work on government drug policy in the UK\n00:11:20 - A scale for rating the relative harm of certain drugs\n00:17:44 - The contrast in regulation between cannabis vs. alcohol and why research on potential benefits of cannabis is lacking\n00:23:35 - The opiate crisis and rise of fentanyl: the cause and potential solution\n00:33:11 - The science of addiction and the potential use of psychedelics for treating drug addiction\n00:41:32 - Cocaine: mechanisms of action and risks\n00:48:38 - Methamphetamine and crystal meth: mechanisms of action and neurotoxicity\n00:53:12 - How psychedelics came to be classified as schedule I drugs despite their numerous therapeutic uses\n01:09:45 - The history of MDMA and the bad science and political forces leading to its demonization\n01:14:26 - History of ketamine, medical use of esketamine, and the waning effects of psychedelics with increasing usage\n01:21:28 - Psilocybin for depression: David\u2019s promising research and the roadblocks to more robust experiments\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

He has developed an adaptive therapy approach for treating cancer which has shown promise in improving survival times with less cumulative drug use. In this episode, Bob explains what brought him into medicine, his search for organizing principles from which to understand cancer, and the mathematical modeling of other complex systems that led him to model the dynamics of tumor cell changes in cancer. He discusses his pilot clinical trial treating metastatic prostate cancer, in which he used an evolutionary game theory model to analyze patient-specific tumor dynamics and determine the on/off cycling of treatment. He describes how altering chemotherapy to maximize the fitness ratio between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells can increase patient survival and explains how treatment of metastatic cancer may be improved using adaptive therapy and strategic sequencing of different chemotherapy drugs.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - intro\n00:00:10 - Bob\u2019s unlikely path to medicine and his disappointment with his medical school experience\n00:12:30 - Rethinking the approach to cancer: using first principles and applying mathematical models\n00:29:27 - Relating predator prey-models to cancer\n00:37:50 - Insights into cancer gathered from ecological models of pests and pesticides\n00:47:27 - Bob\u2019s pilot clinical trial: the advantages of adaptive therapy compared to standard prostate cancer treatment\n00:55:25 - New avenues of cancer therapy: utilizing drug-sensitive cancer cells to control drug-resistant cancer cells\n01:03:29 - The vulnerability of small populations of cancer cells and the problem with a \u201csingle strike\u201d treatment approach\n01:14:30 - Using a sequence of therapies to make cancer cells more susceptible to targeted treatment\n01:25:56 - How immunotherapy fits into the cancer treatment toolkit\n01:31:25 - Insights into why cancer spreads, where it metastasizes, and the source-sync trade off of cancer\n01:42:45 - Defining Eco- and Evo-indices and how they can be used to make better clinical decisions\n01:55:24 - Advantages of early screening for cancer\n01:58:36 - Bob\u2019s goals for follow-ups after the success of his prostate cancer trial\n02:09:22 - Treatment options for cancer patients who have been told they have \u201cfailed therapy\u201d\n\nShow notes page: https://peterattiamd.com/robertgatenby/\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

Additionally, Jeremy goes into depth on how one might take advantage of BFR training, including practical applications for athletes and average people, as well as the situations for which BFR training would be most advantageous.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - intro\n00:00:10 - Jeremy\u2019s interest in exercise and weightlifting and his scientific training\n00:05:24 - The microstructure and physiology of muscle\n00:10:42 - Definitions of fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers\n00:20:18 - Comparison of strength vs. hypertrophy\n00:28:00 - Blood flow restriction training and the origins of the Kaatsu system\n00:45:28 - The details and metrics related to exercise under blood flow restriction\n00:54:25 - Considerations when training with blood flow restriction: loading, pace, rest, and risks\n01:06:53 - Blood flow restriction studies and the relationship between muscle size and muscle strength\n01:21:00 - Evidence that increasing muscular strength is not dependent on increasing the size of the muscle\n01:32:35 - Practical applications of blood flow restriction training for athletes and average people\n01:40:50 - Situations in which blood flow restriction training is most advantageous\n01:46:02 - The mechanisms by which blood flow restriction training can produce so much hypertrophy at such low loads\n01:54:26 - Applications of \u201cpassive\u201d blood flow restriction training\n01:59:15 - What experiments would Jeremy do if he had unlimited resources?\n\nShow notes page: https://peterattiamd.com/jeremyloenneke/\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, Lance takes us through his meteoric rise to one of the most famous athletes in the world and his equally accelerated fall from grace. Lance describes how he persevered through his brutal diagnosis of testicular cancer before rattling off a historic run of seven consecutive Tour de France titles all while facing tremendous scrutiny for his alleged use of performance enhancing drugs such as EPO and cortisone. Lance opens up about his decision to come clean about his use of performance enhancing drugs, the remorse for how he treated other people during that time in his life, and the personal growth that\u2019s helped him emerge on the other end of that. Finally, Lance recounts some of favorite stories from his cycling career, reflects on his legacy, and explains how he stays fit at age 50.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - What everyone wants to know\u2014yes and no questions\n00:02:45 - Lance\u2019s childhood and beginnings of a great athlete\n00:14:17 - Lance\u2019s realization that he had a knack for racing after his first pro race at age\n00:18:05 - The move to cycling full time and a desire to compete in the Olympics\n00:22:35 - Metrics tracked early in Lance\u2019s career and his time with Motorola team\n00:31:30 - The grueling nature of the Tour de France and the beginnings of serious drug usage in cycling\n00:42:36 - The impact of EPO on cycling performance\n00:46:55 - Testicular cancer diagnosis\u2014denial, torturous symptoms, and treatment\n01:03:16 - Livestrong is born\n01:07:02 - Return to cycling post-cancer and a crossroad in Lance\u2019s career\n01:15:35 - Lance\u2019s rise to prominence in the late 90s and the growing use of EPO in the sport\n01:31:34 - Racing in the early 2000\u2019s, blood transfusions, and rivalry with Jan Ulrich\n01:45:45 - Retirement in 2005 and a comeback in 2009\n01:52:20 - Lance\u2019s decision to come clean and tell the truth\n02:00:52 - Growth through downfall: learning from his mistakes and helping others after their own fall from grace\n02:12:33 - Moving forward: Living his life, reflecting on his legacy, the state of Livestrong\n02:21:00 - Turning back the clock: Advice Lance would give to his 15 year-old self\n02:26:56 - Keeping fit at age 50\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

Steve is a pioneer in the field of immunotherapies for cancer and a recipient of nearly every major award in science. In this episode, Steve discusses his inspiration for devoting his career to cancer research and describes his keen observation of two cases of spontaneous cancer remission, driving him to learn how to harness the immune system to treat cancer. Steve\u2019s personal story essentially serves as a roadmap for the field of immunotherapy, from the very non-specific therapies such as interleukin-2, the discovery of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cells, and adoptive cell therapy. Perhaps most importantly, Steve expresses his optimism for what lies ahead, especially in the face of some of the more recent discoveries with respect to tumor antigenicity. Finally, Steve discusses the human side of cancer which helps him to never lose sight of why he chose to become a physician.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Steve\u2019s childhood and inspiration to become a physician and medical researcher\n00:11:05 - Patients that influenced Steve\u2019s thinking about cancer and altered the course of his career\n00:17:42 - The discovery of antigen presentation, Steve\u2019s first job, and why he knew he wanted to study cancer\n00:25:42 - Cancer treatment in the early 1970\u2019s and Steve\u2019s intuition to utilize lymphocytes\n00:30:56 - Cancer cells vs. non-cancer cells, and why metastatic cancer is so deadly\n00:37:50 - The problem with chemotherapy and promise of immunotherapy\n00:43:00 - How the immune system works and why it seems to allow cancer to proliferate\n00:52:00 - Steve discovers how to use interleukin-2 to mediate cancer regression\n01:04:56 - The immunogenic nature of certain cancers and the role of mutations in cancer\n01:18:09 - The improbable story of how CAR T cell therapy was developed\n01:30:07 - The discovery of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and engineering of T cells to recognize specific antigens\n01:38:40 - Steve\u2019s experience treating President Ronald Reagan\u2019s colon cancer\n01:44:05 - Why Steve has turned down many tempting job offers to focus on his research at the National Cancer Institute \n01:46:24 - The role of checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy and the promise of adoptive cell therapy\n01:50:07 - Optimism for using immunotherapy to cure all cancers\n01:56:18 - The human side of cancer and the important lessons Peter learned from working with Steve\n\nShow notes page: https://peterattiamd.com/stevenrosenberg/\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this episode, released just before the 20th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, Lawrence and Peter discuss the book and the lasting impact of that day. Lawrence reflects on his personal experiences on that day and how he was first drawn into reporting on the attacks. Lawrence then discusses in detail the history that led up to 9/11 which is really composed of two parallel stories. The first story is of the growing discontent in Muslim countries, the roots of Islamic radicalism, and how two extremists, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, joined forces to create the global terrorist organization Al-Qaeda. The second story is about how interpersonal and institutional conflicts between the FBI and CIA led to a massive failure in intelligence and resulted in multiple missed opportunities to predict and prevent the attacks on September 11th, 2001.

In this episode, Esther describes how being a child of parents who narrowly survived the Holocaust shaped and influenced her perspectives and ultimately led to her to a career in therapy. She discusses how the generational differences in parenting, among other things, led to the rise of individualism with a focus on happiness and self-esteem to the detriment of our relationships and sense of community. Ultimately, the conversation focuses on the value of our relationships with others for one\u2019s sense of wellbeing, ability to deal with past trauma, resilience, and even our lifespan. She uses real world case studies to emphasize the therapeutic value of creating healthy relationships with others and oneself, explaining how our relationships with others can be a mirror into our own maladaptive behaviors. Esther explains how our self-narratives, which are often shaped by past trauma, may negatively impact our relationships with others and our emotional health, and emphasizes the value in trying to change them when warranted.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Esther\u2019s background, adventures in hitchhiking, and how she ended up in the US\n00:07:35 - The lasting effects of the Holocaust on Esther\u2019s parents\n00:17:21 - Grappling with a dark past and feeling alive again after trauma\n00:24:28 - How Esther came to understand her parents in a new light\n00:32:19 - Why Esther chose therapy as her career\n00:43:57 - Using the concept of sexuality to understand society, culture, and people\n00:53:46 - The significance of sexual revolutions, and the similarities of medical advancements and advancements in psychotherapy\n01:03:18 - The impact of the rise of individualism and the focus on happiness and self-esteem\n01:17:13 - Generational differences in parenting and changing role of fathers  \n01:28:07 - How our narratives affect our sense of wellbeing and relationships with others, and the challenge of changing them\n01:43:20 - Generational effects of past trauma, and how relationships to others can be a mirror into your maladaptive behavior\n01:54:25 - The role of willpower in one\u2019s ability change their behavior and improve their relationships\n01:58:44 - How your relationships impact longevity and the importance of being capable of sitting in uncomfortable emotions\n02:06:28 - Esther\u2019s definition of resilience and the dangers of believing everything you think or feel\n02:15:13 - Questions about the human condition that Esther wants to explore\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

Steve's current research seeks to understand the underlying causes of aging, specifically with a long-term goal of developing medical interventions that slow the age-related decay of human health. In this episode, Steve tells Peter about his unusual childhood and stints as a cab driver and lion tamer. He goes on to describe what led to his focus on studying aging and some of the major challenges and limitations of working with laboratory animals. Steve and Peter talk about the relationship between caloric restriction and lifespan, including some of the most important studies exploring this question.

In this episode, she discusses the content of her recent Vanity Fair article, which examined the evidence for the theory that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from a virus lab escape as opposed to a natural virus that came from an animal host. Katherine and Peter walk through the evidence for both theories as well as discuss the long and troubling history of dangerous lab leaks and safety concerns about the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  They also talk about the controversy surrounding gain-of-function research and its funding by the US government. Finally, they conclude with a discussion on the likelihood of definitively establishing the origins of the virus given the Chinese government\u2019s lack of cooperation and highlight the fact that the many barriers to performing a full investigation may be the most troubling aspect of the controversy. This episode was originally recorded on July 6, 2021. \n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - An overview of the lab leak controversy;\n00:04:23 - The troubling history of lab leaks of dangerous pathogens;\n00:07:43 - The zoonotic transmission theory: did SARS2 come from a bat?;\n00:24:05 - The debate about gain-of-function (GoF) research;\n00:32:08 - Questions about US funding of GoF research in China;\n00:51:19 - The uncertain significance of the furin cleavage site;\n00:59:35 - Discerning what\u2019s most important about both the zoonotic transmission and lab leak theories;\n01:21:48 - Barriers to a full investigation;\n\nShow notes page: https://peterattiamd.com/katherineeban2/\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

In this podcast, Gary explains how he developed a healthy skepticism for science as he was transitioning from being a physics major to beginning as a science journalist. He talks about how he was particularly drawn to sussing out \u201cpathologic science,\u201d telling the stories behind his books on the discovery of the W and Z bosons and cold fusion, emphasizing the need for researchers to perform a thorough background analysis. Gary then describes how his work came to focus on public health, nutrition, and obesity.  He provides a great historic overview of obesity research and provides his explanation for why the conventional wisdom today is incorrect.\n\nWe discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - Gary\u2019s background in science and journalism, and developing a healthy skepticism for science;\n00:08:27 - Gary\u2019s boxing experience, and the challenge of appreciating behavioral risk;\n00:18:55 - How Gary developed his writing skills, and what the best science writers do well;\n00:29:53 - Example of how science can go wrong, and the story behind Gary\u2019s first book, Nobel Dreams;\n00:43:22 - Theoretical vs. experimental physicists: The important differentiation and the relationship between the two;\n00:48:52 - Pathological science: research tainted by unconscious bias or subjective effects;\n01:00:39 - Reflecting on the aftermath of writing Nobel Dreams and the legacy of Carlo Rubbia;\n01:05:39 - Scientific fraud: The story of the cold fusion experiments at Georgia Tech and the subject of Gary\u2019s book, Bad Science;\n01:24:45 - Problems with epidemiology, history of the scientific method, and the conflict of public health science;\n01:46:51 - Gary\u2019s first foray into the bad science of nutrition;\n01:58:04 - Research implicating insulin\u2019s role in obesity, and the story behind what led to Gary\u2019s book, Good Calories, Bad Calories;\n02:10:00 - The history of obesity research, dietary fat, and fat metabolism;\n02:21:47 - The evolving understanding of the role of fat metabolism in obesity and weight gain;\n02:32:37 - Mutant mice experiments giving way to competing theories about obesity;\n02:38:30 - How Gary thinks about the findings that do not support his alternative hypothesis about obesity;\n02:45:19 - Challenges with addressing the obesity and diabetes epidemics, palatability and convenience of food, and other hypotheses;\n02:57:30 - Challenging the energy balance hypothesis, and the difficulty of doing good nutrition studies;\n\nShow notes page: https://peterattiamd.com/garytaubes/\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

They explain the need to pay close attention to metrics like average blood glucose, glucose variability, and peak glucose numbers. Additionally, Peter explains why he encourages all his patients, even nondiabetics, to utilize a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) which gives important insights that traditional lab testing and metrics consistently miss. \n\nIn this sneak peek, we discuss:\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:00:10 - The problem with traditional blood tests and metrics for determining metabolic health\n00:05:41 - The superior insights from a continuous glucose monitor\n00:12:30 - Why lower is better than higher: average glucose, glucose variability, and glucose peaks\n\nThis is a special sneak peek of AMA #24. To view the full video, you'll want to become a podcast subscriber. You can subscribe to the podcast and learn more about all the subscriber benefits: https://peterattiamd.com/subscribe.\n\nIn the full episode, we also discuss:\n-Deep dive into average blood glucose and the importance of having the lowest average blood glucose possible\n-Deep dive into glucose variability and why less variability is better\n-Example of how HbA1c and traditional measures could catch metabolic issues too late\n-Postprandial dips in blood glucose as a predictor of subsequent hunger and energy intake\n-Exploring the idea that the suppression of fatty acids is actually causing hunger rather than a low blood glucose\n-Deep dive into peak glucose and why lower peaks is better\n-What the best rodent models tell us about the impact of peak glucose levels\n-Why Peter encourages all his patients to wear a CGM; and\nMore.\n\nShow notes page: https://peterattiamd.com/ama24/\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

He currently serves on the FDA committee evaluating COVID-19 vaccines. In this episode, Paul\u2019s second appearance on The Drive, he provides an update on all the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently deployed, explains why the concerns raised around the mRNA vaccines are not legitimate, and offers his view on the prospects and timeframe of reaching herd immunity. He also takes a deep dive into immunology, explaining the short-term and long-term immune response to both natural infection and vaccination and how these two can function together to provide durable immunity.

They explore some of the specific claims being made around vaccine additives, the timing of when vaccines are given, and claims about issues with the HPV vaccine specifically. Next, Dr. Hotez shares his own journey as a parent of an autistic child and speaks of the challenges of diagnosing autism, what could account for the seeming increase in the prevalence, and whether there is any support for the notion that environmental triggers play a role.

In this episode, he and Peter discuss the content of his book, The Doctor Who Fooled the World: Science, Deception, and the War on Vaccines, which exposes the complex and disturbing story behind the infamous 1998 Lancet paper by Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine and autism. Brian explains how doctors led by Wakefield, a lawyer, and an anti-vaccination parents\u2019 group worked together on a study to validate their preconceived belief that the MMR vaccine caused autism. He reveals what happened behind the scenes as the study was carried out, explains problems in the lab, and discusses inconsistencies in the analysis.

Rick begins by talking about the relationship between salt and high blood pressure, then provides a masterclass into uric acid, and then expertly reveals the mechanisms and pathways by which sugar (specifically fructose) can profoundly impact metabolic health. From there, he explains how he applies this information to real life patients as well as touches on some of the most promising ideas around pharmacotherapy that are being developed in response to the epidemics of fatty liver, insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity. Furthermore, Rick gives his take on artificial sweeteners compared to real sugar, discusses cancer\u2019s affinity for fructose, and much more.\n\nWe discuss:\n-The connection between blood pressure and fructose that shifted Rick\u2019s professional focus [4:00];\n-The relationship between salt and blood pressure (and the role of sugar) [5:45];\n-Defining fructose, glucose, and sugar [19:30];\n-An ancient mutation in apes that explains why humans turn fructose into fat so easily [23:00];\n-The problems with elevated uric acid levels, and what it tells us about how sugar causes disease [31:30];\n-How sugar causes obesity\u2014explaining the difference in glucose vs. fructose metabolism and the critical pathway induced by fructose [40:00];\n-Why drinking sugar is worse than eating it [50:00];\n-Unique ability of sugar to drive oxidative stress to the mitochondria, insulin resistance, and diabetes [54:00];\n-Why cancer loves fructose [1:00:20];\n-The many areas of the body that can use fructose [1:05:00];\n-Fructokinase inhibitors\u2014a potential blockbuster?

[1:16:30];\n-How excess glucose (i.e., high carb diets) can cause problems even in the absence of fructose [1:21:00];\n-Artificial sweeteners vs. real sugar\u2014which is better? [1:29:15];\n-Umami, MSG, alcohol, beer\u2014do these have a role in metabolic illness? [1:33:45];\n-Fructose consumption\u2014Is any amount acceptable? Is fruit okay? Where does Rick draw a hard line? [1:38:45]\n-How does Rick manage the sugar intake of his young kids?

We then discuss the subsequent investigation into Indian and Chinese drug manufacturing plants which revealed that nearly 80% of them are tainted with fraud.

He tells the story of how a panic attack on live TV lead him down a path of self-discovery culminating in a meditation practice which has since transformed his life\u2014in terms of his own personal suffering, his relationships with those closest to him, and his ability to be kind and compassionate (which has its own selfish advantages). Dan also shares some very practical advice and tips for new meditators, dispels some of the myths around meditation, and gives people some things to look forward to as they progress with their practice. Last but not least, we talk about the importance of not passing shame and trauma to our kids and the role that mindfulness and meditation plays in that. \n\nWe discuss:\n-Dan\u2019s meditation book, and the panic attack on live TV that started it all [8:00];\n-Addiction: the spectrum of addiction, the socially acceptable forms, and Dan\u2019s own battle with addiction and depression [13:30];\n-Dan\u2019s drive for self-protection, a defining moment of childhood, and how his upbringing shaped him [20:30];\n-A selfish reason to be kind and compassionate [28:30];\n-Using mindfulness to avoid being controlled by your emotions such as anger and grandiosity [36:15];\n-How Dan found meditation, and how he went from skeptic to someone willing to try it [40:45];\n-Advice for new meditators, misconceptions about meditation, and the difference between changes in state vs. changes in trait [48:00];\n-Difference between being \u201cmindful\u201d versus being \u201cpresent\u201d [55:00];\n-The overlap between psychology and Buddhism, who is the real Buddha, and a Buddhism 101 lesson [57:45];\n-What convinced Dan to finally try meditation, and how did his first session go?

Jason gives his honest take on companies like WeWork, Uber, and Lyft that may give off the appearance of wild success but may instead provide an example of the dangers of perverse incentives. We get into Jason\u2019s backstory, and how his affinity for optimizing efficiency and production in the workplace culminated with the creation of Basecamp, his very successful web-based project management software business. Perhaps most importantly, we get really deep into all aspects of work-life balance and what it really means to \u201cwork hard\u201d (Stay tuned for an AMA-style deep dive into the topic of work-life balance with Jason in the near future). In addition, Jason provides many more valuable nuggets including thoughts on some common mistakes made by businesses today, the value of giving employees autonomy, how to take the right types of risks, why he doesn\u2019t set any goals, and much, much more. \n\nWe discuss:\n-Jason\u2019s background and his early entrepreneurial spirit [9:45];\n-Views on completing higher education and the notion of hard work [24:00];\n-Beliefs around success in business [35:00];\n-WeWork, Uber, and Lyft: Poor business practices and the dangers of perverse incentives [41:30];\n-Jason\u2019s early career: his redesign approach and personal motivation [56:00];\n-The genesis of Basecamp [1:10:00];\n-Why Jason does not set goals but instead focuses on a vision [1:12:15];\n-Workplace motivation and hiring practice [1:20:30];\n-The importance of luck and not overworking [1:32:00];\n-A framework to work less and optimize for workplace autonomy [1:38:00];\n-The importance of saying \u2018no\u2019 more often (and tips for doing so) [1:55:00];\n-A shared passion for watches [2:03:30];\n-Guarding against the perils of phone addiction [2:08:45];\n-Jason\u2019s views on email and chat for communication [2:15:00] and;\n-More.\n\nShow notes page: https://peterattiamd.com/jasonfried/\n\n--------\nAbout:\n\nThe Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking\u2026and a few other things.

David breaks down all the evidence, the role of his unique pharmacy company which tests all its drugs before being dispensed to consumers, and the reason behind the FDA\u2019s tempered reaction to the alarming study results. David makes the argument that Zantac/ranitidine is an inherently unstable molecule which explains the grossly excessive amounts of NDMA (a probable human carcinogen) as opposed to just a contamination for which there could be numerous causes. Finally, David and Peter both provide recommendations for what to do if you or someone you know is currently taking Zantac/ranitidine.\n\nWe discuss:\n-The impetus for starting Valisure, a unique online pharmacy that tests all its medications [6:45];\n-The story behind the recall of valsartan, and the role which Valisure played [24:30];\n-Testing Zantac: The shocking results from Valisure\u2019s initial testing with major potential cancer implications [36:00];\n-NDMA \u2013 the probable human carcinogen found in Zantac/ranitidine [48:45];\n-The epidemiology question: Are we inferring too much from epidemiology?

Rick details the history of MDMA, what lead to its unfortunate criminalization, and his lifelong work trying to protect MDMA (and other psychedelics) from criminalization (and his subsequent attempt to decriminalize it) Through his founding of MAPS, Rick has made enormous progress in debunking many of the exaggerated risks being claimed against MDMA (neurotoxicity, memory loss, depression, Parkinson\u2019s, etc.), and is very close to getting FDA approval for a psychotherapy technique using MDMA. Additionally in this discussion, you will learn about the history of LSD, psilocybin, and other psychedelics and how the combination of the misunderstanding of them with the crackdown on drug use in the 1970s lead to their designation of schedule 1 substances. But it\u2019s important to note that you will also realize from this discussion just how different MDMA is compared to the average psychedelic. We end this discussion with a message of hope: there are going to be many people who are going to wonder what can they do to receive this MDMA therapy. We talk about what those clinical trials look like, what the enrollment looks like, and perhaps more importantly, what a compassionate use license would look like, such that if there are patients who are in need of this therapy (prior to its approval) they can have an understanding of the legal paths to doing just that. \n\nWe discuss:\n-Discovering MDMA, how Rick learned about it and his first experiences with it [9:45];\n-The timeline of MDMA\u2019s evolution, the reinvention in the 1970s, \u201cecstasy\u201d, the criminalization of MDMA [21:10];\n-Explaining the different \u201cschedules\u201d of drugs [30:55];\n-Rick\u2019s fight to protect it for therapeutic uses, losing to the DEA despite winning in the court, the scientific community, and the media [38:25];\n-The risks involved with taking MDMA [42:30];\n-An incredible MDMA-LSD case study: Rick\u2019s story of healing a treatment-resistant PTSD patient in the 1980s [44:45];\n-How and why MDMA was declared illegal on an emergency basis going against the judge\u2019s recommendation after hearing Rick\u2019s compelling case (and multiple appeals) in court [57:15];\n-Rick\u2019s decision to study politics to affect change from the inside out, and the recent progress being made with the DEA [1:07:00];\n-Debunking the exaggerated risks of MDMA (e.g., neurotoxicity) [1:16:30];\n-Rick\u2019s unbelievable ability to play the long game [1:28:45];\n-Which patients would not be good candidates for MDMA from a safety perspective?

He also walks us through the timeline of advancements (and lack there of) from when the War on Cancer was declared in the 1970s, through the sequencing of the entire human genome, and all the way to today. Keith dives into the topic of immunotherapy, probably the most exciting recent development in cancer therapy, and also provides us a rundown of his notion of a different approach to cancer that attacks all the essential pillars of cancer growth and survival. Finally, we talk a little bit about liquid biopsies, we discuss the roles of CRISPR and other potentially over-hyped therapies with respect to cancer. We also touch on stem cell therapy a bit, as well as some other common cancer-related questions such as the role of vitamin D and sun exposure in melanoma, and much more. \n\nWe discuss\n-Growing up around medicine, and finding a career that you love [7:30]\n-Medicine as a career, limitations of the med school teaching approach, and the dynamic and accelerating field of medicine and technology [16:30]\n-Explaining chemotherapy, radiation, and how a cancer develops [23:45]\n-Surgical oncology, cure rate of solid tumors, and survival rate after tumor removal  [33:15]\n-25 years after the War on Cancer is declared, gene sequencing, and why Keith\u2019s was fascinated by the HIV case study [37:15]\n-Cancer immunotherapy: History, how it works, and why some cancers respond and others don\u2019t [46:00]\n-MHC complexes, and cancer cloaking mechanisms [56:00]\n-Comparative biology of cancer: Why some cancer can evade immune detection better than others [1:03:00]\n-What we learned from the Cancer Genome Atlas Project [1:07:00]\n-Defining targeted therapy, HER2 breast cancer, chronic leukemia, and the translocation of chromosomes [1:12:00]\n-Tumor protein P53, the most famous tumor suppressor gene and its ubiquity in cancer [1:17:45]\n-Activated oncogenes, the RAS pathway, PI3 kinase, RAF gene, and Keith\u2019s \u201caha moment\u201d [1:24:15]\n-Advice for starting your career as a scientist/clinician [1:37:00]\n-Fusion-driven cancers, targeted therapy, and the Bcr-Abl/chronic myelogenous leukemia case study [1:39:45]\n-Targeted therapy for fusion-driven solid tumors, adjuvant systemic therapy, and the HER2 breast cancer example [1:53:00]\n-Advancing melanoma treatment, survival, and cure rates with BRAF-MEK combo therapy [1:59:15]\n-The fundamental pillars of cancer growth and survival, and the toolkit we need to attack cancer from all angles [2:02:40]\n-Peter\u2019s clinical framework for thinking about cancer and how Keith might improve it, and how the biotech environment is hampering our ability to put together novel cancer treatments [2:05:00]\n-How useful is CRISPR in terms of tumor suppressing?

We go through the decision-making matrix, and how we spend most of our energy focusing on just one of the four quadrants at the expense of the learning opportunities that come from the other 75% of situations. Annie also shares how this evaluation of only the bad outcomes (and our tendency to judge others more harshly than ourselves in the face of a non-status quo decision), leads individuals, leaders, and teams to avoid bad outcomes at all costs. This avoidance is at the cost of the types of decisions which lead to progress and innovation both personally, and societally, across many realms from poker to sports to business to medicine. We also dive deep into a framework for learning, and the levels of thought required to rise to the top of a given domain. Finally, we talk about something that resonated deeply with me in terms of how I think about extending healthspan, which is the concept of \u201cbackcasting\u201d.\n\nWe discuss:\n-Annie\u2019s background, favorite sports teams, and Peter\u2019s affinity for Belichick [7:30];\n-Chess vs. poker: Which is a better metaphor for decision making in life (and medicine)?

Peter and Raj discuss the implications of such a robust, radiation-free imaging tool on the early detection of cancer. They dive deep into cancer screening and define terms such as sensitivity and specificity that are necessary to really understand this complex space. They then describe the biggest risks involved in this type of screening (false positives) and how Raj\u2019s unique technology and process might drive down this risk substantially. But before that, they discuss all the common imaging technology from X-ray, to CT scan, to PET scans, to ultrasound, to MRI, and more. They touch on the history of each, how they work, the usefulness and limitations of each of them, as well as the varying risks involved such as radiation exposure. If you are interested in cancer screening and/or you\u2019ve ever wondered how any radiology tool works, this episode is for you.\n\nWe discuss:\n-Raj\u2019s road from engineering to radiology [7:45];\n-How X-ray works, the risk of radiation exposure, and the varying amounts of radiation associated with the different imaging technologies [18:00];\n-Computed tomography scans (CT scans): The history of CT, how it works, and why we use contrast [27:45];\n-Ultrasound: Benefits and limitations, and a special use for the heart [40:45];\n-Detecting breast cancer with mammography: When is works, when you need more testing, and defining \u2018sensitivity\u2019 and \u2018specificity\u2019 [51:15];\n-Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): How it works, defining terms, and looking at the most common types of MRI [1:03:45];\n-Brain aneurysms: Using MRI to find them and save lives [1:23:45];\n-Raj\u2019s unique MRI technology [1:30:00];\n-The risk of false positives in cancer detection, and how Raj\u2019s MRI can reduce the number of false positives (i.e., increase specificity) [1:43:40];\n-The unique software Raj created to pair with his MRI machine [1:51:15];\n-Comparing the radiation exposure of a whole-body PET-CT to Raj\u2019s equipment (DWIBS-MRI) [1:53:40];\n-How diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has revolutionized cancer screening [1:55:15];\n-Why a DW-MRI is still not a perfect test [1:59:00]; \n-The potential for advancing MRI technology: Where does Raj think it could improve in the next 5-10 years? [2:03:00];\n-Are there any commercially available scanners that can match the resolution of Raj\u2019s images? [2:06:00];\n-Machine learning: When and where might machine learning/AI impact the field of radiology?

Their book takes on the very polarizing and confusing topic of hormone replacement therapy for women suffering with symptoms of menopause. In many ways, the story and history of HRT is in striking parallel to the bad science that led up to the dietary guidelines being set forth in 1980. Carol and Avrum make a compelling case that most women benefit greatly from being on postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, and can do so without increasing their risk of breast cancer. We also cover the history of HRT, the impact of the Women\u2019s Health Initiative, and take a deep dive into each of the clinical conditions for which HRT should be considered, such as cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease, and osteoporosis, to name a few.\n\nDr. Bluming has graciously offered his email to take questions directly from fans of this podcast: avrumzbluming@gmail.com\n\nWe discuss:\n-The background of Carol and Avrum, and the impetus for writing Estrogen Matters [8:45];\n-The sad early history of hormone replacement therapy, treatments for prostate and breast cancer, and the difference between the treatment of women vs. men [14:00];\n-What hormones do, and why they drop off rapidly in women compared to gradually in men [20:15];\n-Mistreatment of women leading to great skepticism [23:45];\n-Breast cancer vs heart disease: Comparing the incidence and mortality in women [27:00];\n-Case studies of women suffering symptoms of menopause [30:00];\n-What are Carol and Avrum\u2019s true motivations in this endeavor?
