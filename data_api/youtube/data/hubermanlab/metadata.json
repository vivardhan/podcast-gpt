We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying cognition and the forms of memory required for focus, productivity, planning and achieving goals, and learning. We discuss neurochemicals such as dopamine and acetylcholine and how they can be leveraged to improve cognitive functioning. We also discuss concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, and ways to restore or slow cognitive decline by using pharmacologic, lifestyle and behavioral protocols. This episode provides a modern understanding of cognition and memory and actionable tools to optimize brain health and function.\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/hubmerman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\n*Dr. Mark D'Esposito*\nAcademic profile: https://bit.ly/49wwPMo \nLab website: https://bit.ly/3I4Sxev \nBrainHealth project: https://bit.ly/3SEiZ3w \nPublications: https://bit.ly/3T4AH1J \nX: https://twitter.com/mtdespo \n\n*Journal Articles*\nCognitive and attentional mechanisms in delay of gratification: https://bit.ly/49zpHPL\nInverted-U\u2013Shaped Dopamine Actions on Human Working Memory and Cognitive Control: https://bit.ly/3UdfWBP\nCognitive Deficit Caused by Regional Depletion of Dopamine in Prefrontal Cortex of Rhesus Monkey: https://bit.ly/4bBqMI9\nClinical experience with the \u03b12A-adrenoceptor agonist, guanfacine, and N-acetylcysteine for the treatment of cognitive deficits in \u201cLong-COVID19\u201d: https://bit.ly/42IuviW\nEstrogen Shapes Dopamine-Dependent Cognitive Processes: Implications for Women's Health: https://bit.ly/42G4xwF\nOngoing dynamics in large-scale functional connectivity predict perception: https://bit.ly/3SMFT92\n\n*Other Resources*\nBrainHQ: https://bit.ly/3I6y5d6\nThe BrainHealth Project: https://bit.ly/3I591Dm \nNeuroscouting: https://bit.ly/42IpZB8 \n\n*Huberman Lab Episodes Mentioned*\nNicotine's Effects on the Brain & Body & How to Quit Smoking or Vaping: https://go.hubermanlab.com/GpyRhoQTYT\nTools to Enhance Working Memory & Attention: https://go.hubermanlab.com/s7LQP1bsYT \nDr. Matthew Walker: The Science & Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep: https://go.hubermanlab.com/psVAPrDqYT \nHow Psilocybin Can Rewire Our Brain, Its Therapeutic Benefits & Its Risks: https://go.hubermanlab.com/ggl7TvJuYT \n\n*People Mentioned*\nBrian Levine: Professor Dept. of Psychology, University of Toronto: https://bit.ly/49h05qz\nMatthew Walker: Professor of Neuroscience & Psychology, UC Berkeley: https://bit.ly/3UK2Ags\nMichael Merzenich: Professor Emeritus - Neuroscience, USCF: https://bit.ly/3T4rSoD\nDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel: Nobel Prize (1981): https://bit.ly/3T6SPYQ\nEmily Jacobs: Associate Professor of Psychology, UC Santa Barbara: https://bit.ly/3T0AaOa\nArt Kramer: Professor Emeritus, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign: https://bit.ly/48l4982\nEddie Chang: Professor of Neurological Surgery, UCSF: https://bit.ly/3SLsjmd\nKarl Deisseroth: Professor and Psychiatrist, Stanford: https://stanford.io/49BQmuG\nSepideh Sadaghiani: Associate Professor of Psychology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign: https://bit.ly/48CagoF\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Dr. Mark D\u2019Esposito\n00:02:08 Sponsors: Maui Nui, Joovv & Eight Sleep\n00:06:23 Brain & Frontal Lobes, Prefrontal Cortex, Executive Function\n00:10:31 Frontal Lobe Development, Children\n00:14:12 Rules, Context & Impulse Control;

The good news is all of them are easy, take a limited amount of time, and are either zero cost or will save you costs.\n\nMany of the suggested protocols from experts are counterintuitive. The field of oral health has undergone significant strides in recent years, and the episode reflects the latest.\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I explain the key role of dopamine and the biological mechanisms underlying working memory and how working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.\n\nI also describe science-supported tools to enhance working memory and attention\u2014including zero- or low-cost behavioral, supplemental and pharmacologic approaches. I include how to assess your working memory and how to use memory tasks to determine your baseline dopamine levels in certain brain circuits.\n\nThis episode provides listeners with highly actionable tools to assess and improve their attention to specific tasks and task-switching capacity and to enhance their overall productivity.\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMateina: https://drinkmateina.com/huberman \nBetterHelp:  https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\n*Social & Website*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Journal Articles*\nWorking Memory Capacity Predicts Dopamine Synthesis Capacity in the Human Striatum: https://bit.ly/3UjmP4z\nInverted-U\u2013Shaped Dopamine Actions on Human Working Memory and Cognitive Control: https://bit.ly/3UdfWBP\nCognitive Deficit Caused by Regional Depletion of Dopamine in Prefrontal Cortex of Rhesus Monkey: https://bit.ly/49g3yW5\nThe dopamine agonist bromocriptine differentially affects fronto-striatal functional connectivity during working memory: https://bit.ly/3SyMjcY\nIncreased dopamine tone during meditation-induced change of consciousness: https://bit.ly/3QDfE53\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3HCniHC\nThe Effect of Binaural Beats on Visuospatial Working Memory and Cortical Connectivity: https://bit.ly/3SAFuHT\nTyrosine Improves Working Memory in a Multitasking Environment: https://bit.ly/48QQjv8\n\n*Resources*\nNSDR: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u&feature=shared\nThe Science & Use of Cold Exposure for Health & Performance: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wqrjXIsYYT\n\n*Huberman Lab Episodes Mentioned*\nUnderstand & Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools: https://go.hubermanlab.com/miohHKRSYT\nADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XReodaB9YT\nAdderall, Stimulants & Modafinil for ADHD: Short- & Long-Term Effects: https://go.hubermanlab.com/VS83tuCgYT\nLeverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort: https://go.hubermanlab.com/LgeyAbznYT\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WMwb80NkYT\n\n*People Mentioned*\nDonald Hebb: Psychologist, influential contributions to understanding of learning: https://bit.ly/4bbhXEx\nMark D\u2019Esposito: Psychology Professor at the University of California, Berkeley: https://bit.ly/3vRcFhj\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Working Memory\n00:01:12 Sponsors: Mateina, BetterHelp & Helix Sleep\n00:05:00 Short- vs. Long-Term Memory\n00:09:59 Neuroplasticity\n00:15:42 Working Memory;

First, we discuss a paper on how bright light exposure at sunrise and throughout the day and dark exposure at night independently improve mental health and can offset some of the major symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Then, we discuss an article that explores a novel class of immunotherapy treatments to combat cancer. We also discuss some of the new data on low-calorie sweeteners and if they are safe. This episode should be of interest to listeners curious about maximizing their vitality and longevity and to anyone seeking science-supported ways to improve mental health and lifespan.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nBetterHelp:  https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nJoovvv: https://joovv.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nDr. Peter Attia\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nThe Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter\nEarly Medical: https://earlymedical.com \nX: https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD \n\nJournal Articles\nDay and night light exposure are associated with psychiatric disorders: an objective light study in greater than 85,000 people (first article discussed): https://go.nature.com/47aIZcp\nEarly evening light mitigates sleep compromising physiological and alerting responses to subsequent late evening light: https://go.nature.com/3S84JzV\nAbsence of Circadian Phase Resetting in Response to Bright Light Behind the Knees: https://bit.ly/3Sr4Qb1\nTime spent in outdoor light is associated with mood, sleep, and circadian rhythm-related outcomes: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study in over 400,000 UK Biobank participants: https://bit.ly/3Oe376l\nImproved Survival with Ipilimumab in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma (second article discussed): https://bit.ly/492TmzX\nUnderstanding the Warburg Effect: The Metabolic Requirements of Cell Proliferation: https://bit.ly/3OaZr5o\nScreening for the Lynch Syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer): https://bit.ly/3HqgjBx\nAutoimmunity Correlates With Tumor Regression in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Treated With Anti\u2013Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen-4: https://bit.ly/3U6G3KA\n\nOther Resources\nTuo: https://www.thetuolife.com \nLight Meter app (Google Play): https://bit.ly/3ubAIXL\nLight Meter app (App Store): https://apple.co/47GJivn\nCarbon app: https://www.joincarbon.com \nFluorescence & Mammals: https://nyti.ms/493aTYU\nDr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health & Performance: https://go.hubermanlab.com/nEZXQlCXYT\nSugar Substitutes: https://bit.ly/48IJR9e\nThe mechanisms of action for immune checkpoint inhibitors: https://bit.ly/3SqTi7v\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Peter Attia, Journal Club\n00:02:40 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, BetterHelp & Joovv \n00:07:14 Light, Dark & Mental Health;

Daily.\n\nOne thing is made clear: there is no way to avoid internal agony if your goal is to be the ultimate version of yourself.\n\nThe good news is that anyone can do it, but it requires going inward. Over and over again. David explains how.\n\nHe also explains how people get distracted by the observable things in others \u2014 choosing to point their fingers at others, criticize, focus on hacks, etc, as a way to avoid doing the real internal work for themselves.\n\nThe episode is a roadmap anyone can apply to better themselves, but only if they are willing to embrace the full reality of their deepest self-doubts, fears, shame, and darkness. As David explains, that\u2019s the basement and the place from where true growth starts.\n\nWatch the full episode on YouTube: https://youtu.be/nDLb8_wgX50\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I also dispel common myths about how the cold and flu are transmitted and when you and those around you are contagious. \n\nI explain if common preventatives and treatments such as vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D and echinacea work. I also highlight other compounds known to reduce contracting and duration of colds and flu. \n\nI discuss how to use exercise and sauna to bolster the immune response. \n\nThis episode will help listeners understand how to reduce the chances of catching a cold or flu and help people recover more quickly from and prevent the spread of colds and flu.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nArticles\nA social chemosignaling function for human handshaking: https://go.hubermanlab.com/eWMWr5T6YT\nThere is chemistry in social chemistry: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wIjg4eIiYT\nAlterations in Oral\u2013Nasal\u2013Pharyngeal Microbiota and Salivary Proteins in Mouth-Breathing Children: https://go.hubermanlab.com/pww3thWHYT\nHuman nasal microbiota: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XWfDZyZBYT\nHow (and why) the immune system makes us sleep: https://go.hubermanlab.com/TL09NaWxYT\nThe compelling link between physical activity and the body's defense system: https://go.hubermanlab.com/XXvkR83eYT\nThe effects of a single and a series of Finnish sauna sessions on the immune response and HSP-70 levels in trained and untrained men: https://go.hubermanlab.com/0uiWBVO5YT\nRetracted: Extra Dose of Vitamin C Based on a Daily Supplementation Shortens the Common Cold: A Meta-Analysis of 9 Randomized Controlled Trials: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WxCUtZmXYT\nVitamin D supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data: https://go.hubermanlab.com/POdJvqscYT\nAttenuation of influenza-like symptomatology and improvement of cell-mediated immunity with long-term N-acetylcysteine treatment: https://go.hubermanlab.com/TLcxQb74YT\n\nBooks\n\"Jaws: The Story of a Hidden Epidemic\": https://amzn.to/3TUXc9Z\n\nOther Resources\nNon-sleep Deep Rest (NSDR): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u&feature=shared\nToolkit for Sleep: https://go.hubermanlab.com/AEUHya3EYT\nFoundational Fitness Protocol: https://go.hubermanlab.com/fyv8uNAsYT\nDr. Roger Seheult (YouTube): https://youtu.be/fZ8rqZK_RiA\n\nHuberman Lab Episodes Mentioned\nDr. Noam Sobel: How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health & Behavior: https://go.hubermanlab.com/HvLJaHqOYT\nSleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing: https://go.hubermanlab.com/KLIjm41TYT\nHow to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain & Overall Health: https://go.hubermanlab.com/WYUmGKSpYT\nTools for Managing Stress & Anxiety: https://go.hubermanlab.com/UMxC11EAYT\nDr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain & Repair Gut Health: https://go.hubermanlab.com/R1k012Z1YT\nFitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health: https://go.hubermanlab.com/PO8bdasCYT\nUsing Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System: https://go.hubermanlab.com/20F6rGcHYT\nGuest Series with Dr. Andy Galpin: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4N_PVVoq0Za03YKASSGCazr\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Avoid Colds & Flu\n00:01:58 Sponsors: Joovv, Helix Sleep & ROKA\n00:06:00 Common Cold: Source & Transmission;

This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Annual and Lifetime Members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.\n\nHuberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\n\nIf you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023.\n\nIf you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-14-2023-philanthropy-evening-routine-light-therapy-health-metrics-more\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:00:34 2023 Scientific Research Contributions\n00:07:07 Anterior Mid Cingulate Cortex Studies: Discussion on Research & Findings\n00:12:32 Evening Routines and Light: Insights on Managing Light Exposure Before Sleep\n00:21:26 Light Therapy in Northern Regions: Tips for Coping With Limited Morning Light\n00:28:48 Annual Health and Fitness Metrics: Key Metrics to Monitor Yearly\n00:39:59 Dealing With Midnight Wakefulness: Strategies for Falling Back Asleep\n00:46:41 Strength Training for Women: Protocols for Strength Without Hypertrophy\n00:50:56 Full Body Scan MRIs: Evaluating the Benefits and Usage\n00:55:07 Dog Wellness and Communication: Potential Exploration Into Canine Well-Being\n00:56:17 Balancing Muscle Strength: Strategies for Equalizing Arm Strength\n01:00:54 Content on Children's Development: Future Plans and Current Resources\n01:03:23 Conclusion & Thank You\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #AMA\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

We address the \u201ccalories in- calories out\u201d (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.\n\nFor the show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-lustig-how-sugar-processed-foods-impact-your-health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Robert Lustig\nWebsite: https://robertlustig.com \nBooks: https://robertlustig.com/books\nPublications: https://robertlustig.com/publications\nBlog: https://robertlustig.com/blog\nUCSF academic profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robert.lustig \nMetabolical (book): https://amzn.to/48mNhOE\nSugarScience: http://sugarscience.ucsf.edu \nX: https://twitter.com/RobertLustigMD\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DrRobertLustig\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-lustig-8904245 \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/robertlustigmd \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@robertlustigmd \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robert Lustig\n00:02:02 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & AeroPress\n00:06:41 Calories, Fiber\n00:12:15 Calories, Protein & Fat, Trans Fats\n00:18:23 Carbohydrate Calories, Glucose vs. Fructose, Fruit, Processed Foods\n00:26:43 Fructose, Mitochondria & Metabolic Health\n00:31:54 Trans Fats;

Hiccups are caused by spasming of the phrenic nerve to diaphragm connection. Based on the way the phrenic nerve controls the diaphragm, you can stop that spasm by inhaling three times in a row with no exhales in between, then holding your breath for 15 to 30 seconds, and then slowly exhaling. \n\nDone correctly, this should eliminate hiccups the first time and every time, but if it's a severe spasm, you may have to repeat it a few times. All the other purported methods out there, such as drinking a glass of water backward, upside down, or scaring someone, etc., are all designed to adjust the pattern of diaphragmatic control by the brain. The technique described here actually does that.\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.\n\nFor the show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-adam-grant-how-to-unlock-your-potential-motivation-unique-abilities\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman \n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nDr. Adam Grant\nWebsite: https://adamgrant.net \nBooks: https://adamgrant.net/books\nPodcasts: https://adamgrant.net/podcasts\nAcademic profile: https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/grantad\nTED Talk: \u201cAre You a Giver or a Taker?\u201d: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker \nTED Talk: \u201c The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers\u201d: https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_the_surprising_habits_of_original_thinkers \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamgrant \nX: https://twitter.com/adammgrant \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AdamMGrant \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@adamgrant \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Adam Grant\n00:01:37 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels & Waking Up\n00:05:56 Procrastination & Emotion;

These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the \u201cBig 6\u201d core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being. Then, I explain science-based tools to directly increase confidence, build a stronger concept of self, better understand our unconscious mind, manage stress and improve our emotional tone and processing. I also explain ways to better process negative emotions and traumas.

She explains what emotions are and how the brain represents and integrates signals from our body and the environment around us to create our unique emotional states. We discuss the relationship between emotions and language, how our specificity of language impacts our emotional processing, the role of facial expressions in emotions, and how emotions relate to sleep, movement, nutrition and the building and reinforcement of social bonds. We also discuss actionable tools for how to regulate feelings of uncertainty and tools to better understand the emotional states of others. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone curious about the neuroscience and psychology underlying emotions and for those who seek to better understand themselves and relate to others and the world in richer, more adaptive ways.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Emotions\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Lisa Feldman Barrett\nWebsite: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com \nAcademic Profile: https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/lisa-barrett \n\"How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain\": https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/how-emotions-are-made\n\"Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain\": https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/books/seven-and-a-half-lessons-about-the-brain \nTED Talk: https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/2018/01/13/ted-talk-you-arent-at-the-mercy-of-your-emotions-your-brain-creates-them \nX: https://twitter.com/lfeldmanbarrett \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@professor.lisa \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-feldman-barrett\n\nArticles\nEmotional Expressions Reconsidered: Challenges to Inferring Emotion From Human Facial Movements: https://bit.ly/46R3XNq\n\nBooks\n\"Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution\": https://amzn.to/3QirDEZ\n\"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma\": https://amzn.to/3rUQyVO\n\"An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us\": https://bit.ly/3QhMFU9\n\"I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life\": https://amzn.to/3M2CY9B\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding & Healing the Mind: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/karl-deisseroth-understanding-and-healing-the-mind\nCounterintuitive Ideas About How the Brain Work (Lex Fridman Podcast): https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett\nLove, Evolution, and the Human Brain (Lex Fridman Podcast):: https://lexfridman.com/lisa-feldman-barrett-2\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett\n00:03:01 Sponsors: Eight Sleep & Levels \n00:05:46 Core Components of Emotions\n00:10:42 Facial Movement & Interpretation, Emotion\n00:19:33 Facial Expressions & Emotion, Individualization\n00:31:03 Emotion Categories, Culture & Child Development\n00:36:53 Sponsor: AG1\n00:37:50 Legal System, \u2018Universal\u2019 Emotions & Caution\n00:41:07 Language Descriptions, Differences & Emotion\n00:48:18 Questions & Assumptions;

Then I discuss the neural basis of willpower in the brain and body and how tenacity and willpower relate to sleep, stress, focus and possibly to lifespan.

He describes how the foundation of mental health is an understanding of one\u2019s own mind and the specific questions to ask in order to explore the conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves. He describes how this process can be done either on our own, through journaling, meditation and structured thought, or in therapy with the help of a licensed professional. He also explains how unprocessed trauma can short-circuit the process and how to prevent that, and the role of friendships and other relational support systems in the journey of self-exploration for mental health. People of all ages and those with and without self-introspection and therapy experience ought to benefit from the information in this episode.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MentalHealth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzn.to/3GVLHXw\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health (Episode 1): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health (Episode 2): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-improve-your-mental-health\nGuest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Build and Maintain Healthy Relationships (Episode 3): https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-build-and-maintain-healthy-relationships\nThe Iceberg Model: https://bit.ly/3LDNCn1\nPillars of Mental Health: https://bit.ly/48y0cOo\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Self Care\n00:02:37 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up\n00:05:34 What is Self-Care?, Foundation, Self-Understanding\n00:13:18 Life Narratives\n00:15:24 Journaling, Self-Inquiry & Therapy\n00:24:41 Unconscious Mind, Salience & Journaling; Panic Attacks\n00:28:20 Self-Inquiry; Grief & Death\n00:33:23 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:39 Self-Harm, Hopelessness & Therapy\n00:37:27 Apprehension of Unconscious Mind Exploration\n00:42:34 Mental Health Map: Cupboards, Agency & Gratitude, Generative Drive\n00:54:18 Structure of Self, Unconscious Mind, Abscess Analogy\n01:01:57 Exploring the Unconscious Mind, Curiosity, \u201cQuestion the Givens\u201d\n01:10:48 Conscious Mind Exploration; Self Curiosity, Busyness\n01:19:20 Exploring Defense Mechanisms, Character Structure\n01:24:54 Self & Character Structure, \u201cTending the Garden\u201d\n01:32:45 Function of Self Cupboards\n01:35:50 Self-Awareness Exploration, Mirror Meditation\n01:38:34 Defense Mechanisms in Action & Self-Inquiry, Patterns\n01:47:15 Salience Exploration, Grounding Meditation\n01:52:37 Behavior & Self-Reflection; Phantom Driver Analogy\n02:00:14 Self & Strivings; Empowerment & Humility\n02:09:07 Challenges in Certain Life Domains\n02:17:49 Friendships & Support, Social Media\n02:23:50 Anger & Self-Care\n02:34:18 Self-Care & Challenges\n02:38:43 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

He explains a roadmap of the conscious and unconscious mind that can allow anyone to navigate conflicts better and set healthy boundaries in relationships. We also discuss common features of unhealthy relationships and clinically supported tools for dealing with relationship insecurity, excessive anxiety, past traumas, manipulation and abuse. Dr. Conti explains how, in healthy relationships, there emerges a dynamic of the mutually generative \u201cus\u201d and how to continually improve that dynamic.

I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory.

Dr. Conti explains specific tools for how to overcome life\u2019s challenges using a framework of self-inquiry that explores all the key elements of self, including defense mechanisms, behaviors, self-awareness and attention. We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful \u201cgenerative drive\u201d of positive, aspirational pursuits. Dr. Conti also explains how to adjust your internal narratives, reduce self-limiting concepts, overcome intrusive thoughts, and how certain defense mechanisms, such as \u201cacting out\u201d or narcissism, show up in ourselves and others. The next episode in this special series explores how to build healthy relationships with others.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #MentalHealth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Paul Conti\nWebsite: https://drpaulconti.com \nPacific Premier Group: https://pacificpremiergroup.com \nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It: https://amzn.to/3GVLHXw\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-paul-m-conti-845074216\n\nResources\nGUEST SERIES | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health\nThe Iceberg Model: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Iceberg-Model.pdf\nPillars of Mental Health: https://hubermanlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Pillars-of-Mental-Health.pdf\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Improve Mental Health\n00:02:19 Sponsors: BetterHelp & Waking Up App\n00:05:26 Structure & Function of Healthy Self \n00:16:25 Agency & Gratitude\n00:21:14 Aggressive Drive, Pleasure Drive, Generative Drive\n00:30:00 Physical & Mental Health Similarities, Verb States\n00:37:05 Sponsor: AG1\n00:38:32 Lack of Motivation, Drives\n00:43:06 Video Games/Social Media & Distraction, Generative Drive\n00:51:46 Asking Better Questions, Psychiatric Medicine, Physical Health Parallels\n00:59:10 Sponsor: Eight Sleep\n01:00:30 Self-Reflection & Structure of Self \u201cCupboards\u201d, Trauma & Agency\n01:08:53 Feeling Stuck, Defense Mechanisms & Sublimation, Character\n01:13:58 Self-Reflection & Function of Self \u201cCupboards\u201d, Self-Awareness\n01:19:24 Defense Mechanisms & \u201cActing Out\u201d\n01:26:43 Salience, Intrusive Thoughts\n01:31:24 Self-Reflection, Behaviors & Strivings; Roadmap Forward\n01:38:25 Internal Narratives, Childhood\n01:44:44 Internal Narratives: Self-Scrutiny & Overcoming; Trauma\n01:55:18 Time Required for Change, Understanding Intrusive Thoughts\n02:03:13 Self-Reflection on Internal Drives; Envy\n02:09:56 Generative Drive; Strong Aggressive Drive & Envy\n02:21:50 High Aggressive Drive & Social Relationships, Narcissism\n02:28:43 Narcissism, Destruction, Envy\n02:37:18 Narcissism & Childhood, Change\n02:41:26 Engaging with Narcissists, Disengagement\n02:44:47 Demoralization, Learned Helplessness\n02:49:34 Self-Inventory of Drives, Optimization\n02:56:09 Social Media & Salience, Generative Drive\n03:03:21 Rational Aspiration\n03:13:16 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPKd99Pa2iU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPKd99Pa2iU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPKd99Pa2iU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPKd99Pa2iU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPKd99Pa2iU/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Andrew Huberman", "playlistId": "UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg", "position": 37, "resourceId": {"kind": "youtube#video", "videoId": "qPKd99Pa2iU"}, "videoOwnerChannelTitle": "Andrew Huberman", "videoOwnerChannelId": "UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg"}, "contentDetails": {"videoId": "qPKd99Pa2iU", "videoPublishedAt": "2023-09-13T12:00:49Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#playlistItem", "etag": "M5drvVi1ZefWwg9PPCCVVweimdY", "id": "VVUyRDJDTVdYTU9WV3g3Z2lXMW4zTElnLno4YzZFeU1OZDBB", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-09-11T12:04:21Z", "channelId": "UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg", "title": "Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Metformin for Longevity & The Power of Belief Effects", "description": "In this journal club episode, my guest is Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician, Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who is also the host of The Drive podcast and the author of the bestselling book \"Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity.\"\n\nWe each present a scientific paper and discuss the findings' strengths, weaknesses and actionable takeaways.\n\nFirst, we discuss an article that addresses whether taking the drug metformin can enhance longevity. Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one's belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose.\n\nOur conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Peter Attia\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nOutlive: The Science & Art of Longevity: https://peterattiamd.com/outlive\nThe Peter Attia Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast\nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter \nX (formerly Twitter): https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd \n\nArticles\nReassessing the evidence of a survival advantage in Type 2 diabetes treated with metformin compared with controls without diabetes: a retrospective cohort study: https://bit.ly/3EypTAJ\nThe Hallmarks of Aging: https://bit.ly/3ZeqnFI\nCan people with type 2 diabetes live longer than those without?

Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors \u2014 either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional.

We discuss individual differences between people \u2014 focusing on differences in how people sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity, and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining our physical and cognitive traits. We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health. We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Linden\u2019s terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life.

I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain\u2019s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term \u2018K-holes\u2019). This episode should interest anyone interested in ketamine, treatments for depression, neuroplasticity mechanisms, psychiatry and mental health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles \nAntidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients: https://bit.ly/44YTGxY\nAttenuation of antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine by opioid receptor antagonism: https://go.nature.com/3qesrR8\natai Life Sciences Announces Results from Phase 2a Trial of PCN-101 (R-ketamine) for Treatment-Resistant Depression: https://bit.ly/47j6wsC \nComparative effects of (S)-ketamine and racemic (R/S)-ketamine on psychopathology, state of consciousness and neurocognitive performance in healthy volunteers: https://bit.ly/44WMxOR\nKetamine Metabolite (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine Interacts with \u03bc and \u03ba Opioid Receptors: https://bit.ly/44e4SWB\n\nOther Resources\nThe Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder (Huberman Lab episode): https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder/\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Ketamine\n00:02:29 Sponsors: ROKA & Eight Sleep\n00:05:13 Ketamine & PCP; Clinical & Recreational Use\n00:09:00 Depression & Current Treatments\n00:15:17 Preclinical Models of Depression & Ketamine; \u201cLearned Helplessness\u201d \n00:22:11 Ketamine & Clinical Uses; Depression & Suicidality \n00:28:32 Ketamine & Other Psychiatric Challenges; Relief & Durability \n00:33:24 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:29 NMDA Receptor & Neuroplasticity\n00:41:36 Excitatory & Inhibitory Communication, Seizure, NMDA Receptors & Ketamine\n00:48:26 How Ketamine Functions in Brain; Acute & Long-Term Effects\n00:55:36 Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) & Ketamine Therapy\n01:02:28 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:03:40 Ketamine & Opioid Pathway \n01:10:00 Divergent Mechanisms of Immediate & Long-Term Effects\n01:15:45 Habenula, Pro-Depressive Behaviors & Ketamine Therapy\n01:20:36 Ketamine & Context-Dependent Strategy; Reward Pathway\n01:22:45 Dissociative States\n01:26:04 Doses & Routes of Administration; \u201cK-holes\u201d; Risk & Caution\n01:32:25 Ketamine Forms; R-, S- vs R/S- Ketamine; Micro-Dosing \n01:38:24 Ketamine: Effects & Therapy\n01:40:40 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

She is the creator and host of the podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self, and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity. Dr. Shankar shares her experience of redefining her identity after an early career-ending setback. She also explains numerous science-based strategies to effectively define goals, structure our goal pursuits and maintain consistent motivation. This episode provides a science-supported toolkit and roadmap to assess your identity and goals and positively transform in the face of change.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Maya Shankar\nWebsite: https://mayashankar.com\nA Slight Change of Plans: https://apple.co/slightchangeofplans\nTED Talk: https://youtu.be/Tt0arZN6EBM\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@drmayashankar\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drmayashankar\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/slightchangepod \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drmayashankar\nPublications: https://mayashankar.com/publications \n\nArticles\nOn the dimensionality of odor space: https://bit.ly/475304P\nComputations of uncertainty mediate acute stress responses in humans: https://go.nature.com/43y8IJG\nThe End of History Illusion: https://bit.ly/3KcPkeh\nAchievement Goals and the Hierarchical Model of Achievement Motivation: https://bit.ly/3rFmrkz\nThey Saw a Game: A Case Study: https://bit.ly/44YMphc\nThe Fresh Start Effect: Temporal Landmarks Motivate Aspirational Behavior: https://bit.ly/46Tszps\nHolding the Hunger Games Hostage at the Gym: An Evaluation of Temptation Bundling: https://bit.ly/44Zax3d\n\nBooks\nChatter: The Voice in Our Head, Why It Matters, and How to Harness It: https://amzn.to/3pZl4g6\nAwe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life: https://amzn.to/3QaS0Nw\nGet It Done: Surprising Lessons from the Science of Motivation: https://amzn.to/3pRxtTu\nThe War for Kindness: Building Empathy in a Fractured World: https://amzn.to/3Kailra\nThinking, Fast and Slow: https://amzn.to/3q3u1VN\n\nOther Resources\nIdentity Paralysis: https://bit.ly/3rFjEYE \nReginald Dwayne Betts: https://nyti.ms/3O52uLx \nRick Rubin: How to Access Your Creativity (Huberman Lab episode): https://bit.ly/44Bjb8B  \nDr. Arie Kruglanski & Cognitive Closure: https://bit.ly/3KanqQ4 \nDr. Ethan Kross & Venting: https://bit.ly/3Qbrt2E \nSlight Change of Plans - Daryl Davis episode: https://bit.ly/3Y6cCbA \nLet\u2019s See a Game: https://bit.ly/44Oca3U \nPeak-end Rule: https://bit.ly/3rIyo9i \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Maya Shankar\n00:02:37 Sponsors: Maui Nui Venison & Eight Sleep\n00:05:15 Identity Foreclosure, Identity Paralysis, Throughlines\n00:12:10 Identity & Adolescence;

I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating \u201cverbs\u201d (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the \u201cstress-is-enhancing mindset,\u201d and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #GrowthMindset\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPraise for intelligence can undermine children's motivation and performance: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-04530-003\nWhy do beliefs about intelligence influence learning success?

We discuss the brain\u2019s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Robert Malenka\nStanford academic profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-malenka\nPublications: https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-malenka?tab=publications \nCurrent clinical trial: https://clinicaltrials.stanford.edu/trials/e/NCT03841682.html \nMapLight: https://maplightrx.com/team/robert-malenka\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-malenka-09b3a016b\n\nArticles\nDistinct neural mechanisms for the prosocial and rewarding properties of MDMA: https://bit.ly/3PNs2ze\nOxytocin receptor is not required for social attachment in prairie voles: https://bit.ly/3XLguOZ\nGating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area: https://bit.ly/3rigeee\nAnterior cingulate inputs to nucleus accumbens control the social transfer of pain and analgesia: https://bit.ly/44z3qP1\nSocial reward requires coordinated activity of nucleus accumbens oxytocin and serotonin: https://go.nature.com/44iOQvl\nSelective filtering of excitatory inputs to nucleus accumbens by dopamine and serotonin: https://bit.ly/44UG8n1\nSerotonin receptor regulation as a potential mechanism for sexually dimorphic oxytocin dysregulation in a model of Autism: https://bit.ly/44DS24e\n5-HT modulation of a medial septal circuit tunes social memory stability: https://go.nature.com/3rjlXk7\n\nOther Resources\nMapLight: https://maplightrx.com \nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nMindMed: https://mindmed.co \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robert Malenka\n00:02:37 Sponsors: ROKA & Levels\n00:05:21 Dopamine & Reward Circuitry\n00:11:31 Reward, Arousal, Memory & Dopamine \n00:17:34 Context, Cues & Dopamine Modification\n00:25:38 Memory & Reward Scaling\n00:30:50 Dopamine, \u201cAddictive Liability\u201d & Route of Administration \n00:39:07 Sponsor: AG1\n00:40:04 Drugs of Abuse & Brain Changes;

We discuss Tim\u2019s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery \u2014 themes that have spanned his career that have placed him on the cutting-edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery, how to find and work with mentors, the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim\u2019s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners, as Tim\u2019s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts. What distinguishes Tim is his ability to thoughtfully deconstruct these processes in order to teach others how to do the same. \n\n#HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTim Ferriss\nPodcast: https://tim.blog/podcast\nBooks by Tim Ferriss: https://tim.blog/tim-ferriss-books\nBlog: https://tim.blog \nTED talks: https://www.ted.com/speakers/tim_ferriss \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/tferriss\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/timferriss\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/timferriss\n\nResources\nPeter Attia \u2018Studying Studies\u2019 series: https://peterattiamd.com/ns001\nPeter Attia episode: https://tim.blog/2023/03/14/peter-attia-outlive \nThe Slow-Carb Diet: https://tim.blog/2012/07/12/how-to-lose-100-pounds\nHow to Lose 20 lbs. of Fat in 30 Days: https://tim.blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise\nSeth Godin episode: https://tim.blog/2016/02/10/seth-godin \nSuicide article: https://tim.blog/2015/05/06/how-to-commit-suicide\nHealing After Childhood Abuse episode: https://tim.blog/2020/09/16/how-to-heal-trauma-transcript\nDog Training episode: https://tim.blog/2016/11/14/susan-garrett\nSaisei Foundation: https://saiseifoundation.org \nThe Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation (POPLAR): https://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/research/the-project-on-psychedelics-law-and-regulation-poplar \nFerriss-UC Berkeley Psychedelic Journalism Fellowship: https://projects.journalism.berkeley.edu/bcsp\nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nWaking Up app: https://www.wakingup.com \nCockpunch: https://cockpunch.com \n\nBooks\nBuilt to Move: https://a.co/d/0z5Q6pu\nWhy We Sleep: https://a.co/d/2Ff5QHH\nThe Art of Fiction: https://a.co/d/1SCNIzl\nBad Science: https://a.co/d/iv5SM24\nHow to Lie with Statistics: https://a.co/d/dhbEsUp\nBrain Energy: https://a.co/d/bt8hTLU\nGold: https://a.co/d/1sWaF1i\nDon't Shoot the Dog: https://a.co/d/d5zOjgH\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Tim Ferriss\n00:04:08 Sponsors: Maui Nui, LMNT, Levels\n00:07:43 4-Hour Body & Development Mindset\n00:15:22 Origins of Good Ideas \n00:20:06 Writing & Structured Thinking\n00:27:58 Writing, Night Owls\n00:33:06 Sponsor: AG1\n00:34:21 Investigating Outliers;

I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces \u201cthreat detection\u201d and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA \u201ccrash,\u201d the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA. This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTDS, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nA Conserved Role for Serotonergic Neurotransmission in Mediating Social Behavior in Octopus: https://bit.ly/3oV8zSl\nEffects of MDMA on sociability and neural response to social threat and social reward: https://bit.ly/3NlOYUC\nThe Effects of Acutely Administered 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine on Spontaneous Brain Function in Healthy Volunteers Measured with Arterial Spin Labeling and Blood Oxygen Level\u2013Dependent Resting State Functional Connectivity: https://bit.ly/42yMEhl\nDistinct neural mechanisms for the prosocial and rewarding properties of MDMA: https://bit.ly/3NlNERM\nPlasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans: https://bit.ly/42AF6e0\nRETRACTED: Severe Dopaminergic Neurotoxicity in Primates After a Common Recreational Dose Regimen of MDMA (\"Ecstasy\"): https://bit.ly/3J9PTVU\nScience forced to retract article on \u201cecstasy\u201d: https://bit.ly/3oRRpVM\nResidual neurocognitive features of long-term ecstasy users with minimal exposure to other drugs: https://bit.ly/3P93gcM\nMDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study: https://go.nature.com/3WqI2Zd\nThe effects of MDMA-assisted therapy on alcohol and substance use in a phase 3 trial for treatment of severe PTSD: https://bit.ly/42wqeNP\n\nBooks\nPIHKAL: A Chemical Love Story: https://amzn.to/45ZY80w\nTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic: https://amzn.to/45VdgfA\nThe Body Keeps the Score: https://amzn.to/3XgH5Dz\n\nOther Resources\nMultidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS): https://maps.org \nParticipate in a MAPS trial: https://maps.org/take-action/participate-in-trial\nHuberman Lab episode on psilocybin: https://bit.ly/43yP80G\nHuberman Lab episode on psychedelics for mental health: https://bit.ly/3NqC3Rz \nHuberman Lab episode on dopamine, mindset & drive: https://bit.ly/3IqQzVb\nHuberman Lab episode on leveraging dopamine: https://bit.ly/3P3dCuD\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 MDMA \u201cEcstasy\u201d\n00:04:37 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, ROKA, HVMN\n00:08:18 MDMA History & Synthesis;

I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use. This episode ought to benefit anyone with ADHD, their parents, those on ADHD medications or anyone curious about how these medications work.\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nCardiovascular Effects of ADHD Therapies: JACC Review Topic of the Week: https://bit.ly/3MDbiri\nBrain alterations in children/adolescents with ADHD revisited: A neuroimaging meta-analysis of 96 structural and functional studies: https://bit.ly/3WDs0ve\nImpulsivity, Compulsivity, and Top-Down Cognitive Control: https://bit.ly/3MM3uUq\nDopaminergic System Dysfunction in Recreational Dexamphetamine Users: https://go.nature.com/3WDM9Bk\nModafinil enhances alerting-related brain activity in attention networks: https://bit.ly/3WLwobF\nAssociation of Intrinsic Brain Architecture With Changes in Attentional and Mood Symptoms During Development: https://bit.ly/3qhaaCl\nCognitive enhancement effects of stimulants: a randomized controlled trial testing methylphenidate, modafinil, and caffeine: https://bit.ly/4270EPr\nPsychostimulants and Cognition: A Continuum of Behavioral and Cognitive Activation: https://bit.ly/3MHqAv6\nNeural Correlates of Symptom Improvement Following Stimulant Treatment in Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: https://bit.ly/3ILu2DI\nLong-term effects of stimulant exposure on cerebral blood flow response to methylphenidate and behavior in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: https://bit.ly/45CQpFu\nMolecular Characterisation of the Mechanism of Action of Stimulant Drugs Lisdexamfetamine and Methylphenidate on ADHD Neurobiology: A Review: https://bit.ly/45Bsl5J\nPharmacologic treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis: https://bit.ly/3J8rEaH\n\nBooks\nStahl's Essential Psychopharmacology (4th Edition): https://a.co/d/fJZekoD\n\nOther Resources\nControlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus & Satisfaction: https://youtu.be/QmOF0crdyRU\nLeverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort: https://youtu.be/K-TW2Chpz4k\nADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus: https://youtu.be/hFL6qRIJZ_Y\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Stimulants & Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \n00:03:21 Sponsors: Maui Nui, ROKA, HVMN \n00:06:35 The Brain-Body Contract\n00:07:22 Attention, Prefrontal Cortex & ADHD\n00:16:27 Stimulants \u201cSympathomimetics\u201d \n00:21:29 Adderall, Dopamine & Norepinephrine\n00:25:58 Sympathomimetics, Dopamine & Norepinephrine\n00:31:05 Sponsor: AG1\n00:32:20 Vyvanse is Timed-Release D-Amp\n00:36:36 Ritalin, Concerta \n00:40:10 Dopamine & \u201cNoise Reduction\u201d;

He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to \u201cgo internal,\u201d and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks. As such, this episode ought to be of use to anyone interested in brain plasticity, mental health, psychology or neuroscience.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nThe Brain Body Contract\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Robin Carhart-Harris\nAcademic Profile: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robin.carhart-harris \nPublications: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/robin.carhart-harris#toc-id3 \nSupport USCF Psychedelic Research Fund: https://makeagift.ucsf.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=A1_API_GeneralGivingForm&Other=Psychedelic%20Research%20Fund%20zzz%207031398-SFFDN\nUCSF Clinical Trials Enrollment: https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/psychedelic-experiences \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RCarhartHarris \nTEDx Talk: https://youtu.be/MZIaTaNR3gk\n\nArticles\nSelf-blinding citizen science to explore psychedelic microdosing: https://bit.ly/3IxMrUJ\nTrial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression: https://bit.ly/3Os2I11\nPivotal mental states: https://bit.ly/3ITFVYH\nIncreased global integration in the brain after psilocybin therapy for depression: https://go.nature.com/3q4Sb1z\nStructure-based discovery of nonhallucinogenic psychedelic analogs: https://bit.ly/41Svyux\nSelf-Medication for Chronic Pain Using Classic Psychedelics: A Qualitative Investigation to Inform Future Research: https://bit.ly/3Wr1q8C\nMDMA-assisted therapy for severe PTSD: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study: https://go.nature.com/3WqI2Zd\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris\n00:02:12 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, Levels, HVMN \n00:05:41 The Brain-Body Contract\n00:06:31 Origin of the Word: \u201cPsychedelics\u201d;

She earned her doctoral degree at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, researching the effects of deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure on metabolism and other aspects of human physiology. We discuss how cold or sauna can improve metabolism, cardiovascular and brain health, balance hormones, and decrease inflammation. Dr. S\u00f8berg discusses how deliberate cold protocols can improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and trigger release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine which enhance energy, mood, and focus. We compare cold showers and cold immersion, traditional and infrared saunas, and other variables.

I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin. This episode is a thorough exploration of psilocybin from the scientific and clinical literature perspective and ought to be of interest to anyone curious about psilocybin, mental health, neuroplasticity and/or psychedelics more generally.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com code: \u201cHuberman\u201d\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nThe neural basis of psychedelic action: https://go.nature.com/3VInMlE\nThe effects of psilocybin and MDMA on between-network resting state functional connectivity in healthy volunteers: https://bit.ly/3VW8iL7\nIncreased low-frequency brain responses to music after psilocybin therapy for depression: https://bit.ly/3LKj6XK\nQuality of Acute Psychedelic Experience Predicts Therapeutic Efficacy of Psilocybin for Treatment-Resistant Depression: https://bit.ly/42c7y6x\nBrief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal: https://bit.ly/3wEvGRf\nTherapeutic use of psilocybin: Practical considerations for dosing and administration: https://bit.ly/3HPHLZM\nPsilocybin induces rapid and persistent growth of dendritic spines in frontal cortex in vivo: https://bit.ly/3HQ8J3z\nPsychedelics and Neuroplasticity: A Systematic Review Unraveling the Biological Underpinnings of Psychedelics: https://bit.ly/44Gpwjx\nSingle-Dose Psilocybin for a Treatment-Resistant Episode of Major Depression: https://bit.ly/3pjvu9N\nEffects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: https://bit.ly/3sFSGMM\nThe costs and benefits of psychedelics on cognition and mood: https://bit.ly/3NNyEwI\n\nOther Resources\nThe Physiological Sigh: https://youtu.be/rBdhqBGqiMc\nDr. Matthew Johnson: Psychedelic Medicine: https://hubermanlab.com/dr-matthew-johnson-psychedelic-medicine\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Psilocybin, Legal Considerations\n00:08:32 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, ROKA, HVMN \n00:12:00 Psilocybin Becomes Psilocin in the Gut, Serotonin \n00:17:00 The Serotonin 2A Receptor, Therapeutic Outcomes SSRIs vs. Psilocybin\n00:21:40 Serotonin Receptor Expression;

Dr. Sobel explains his lab\u2019s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (\u201colfaction\u201d) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of \u201csocial sensing\u201d and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab\u2019s work on digitization of smell \u2014 which may soon allow online communication to include \u201csending of odors\u201d via the internet. Dr. Sobel\u2019s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Smell\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Noam Sobel\nLab website: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg\nLab Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/odorspaceWORG \nPublications: https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/worg/publications \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LabWorg \n\nArticles\nThe Age of Olfactory Bulb Neurons in Humans: https://bit.ly/41NMjb6\nThe Privileged Brain Representation of First Olfactory Associations: https://bit.ly/3LGEePP\nMechanisms of scent-tracking in humans: https://go.nature.com/41Sm03w\nMeasuring and Characterizing the Human Nasal Cycle: https://bit.ly/44dqGmi\nHuman non-olfactory cognition phase-locked with inhalation: https://go.nature.com/44iPIQQ\nA social chemosignaling function for human handshaking: https://bit.ly/3Lo5kK6\nThere is chemistry in social chemistry: https://bit.ly/41TVIhq\nMHC-dependent mate preferences in humans: https://bit.ly/41SbgCc\nAn Exteroceptive Block to Pregnancy in the Mouse: https://go.nature.com/3VnxRnN\nFear-Related Chemosignals Modulate Recognition of Fear in Ambiguous Facial Expressions: https://bit.ly/3NqAPpD\nSniffing the human body volatile hexadecanal blocks aggression in men but triggers aggression in women: https://bit.ly/3oQ6NBv\nMenstrual Synchrony and Suppression: https://go.nature.com/3LRF9xf\nRegulation of ovulation by human pheromones: https://go.nature.com/44jODbt\nHuman Tears Contain a Chemosignal: https://bit.ly/41Qmkjr\nWhy Only Humans Shed Emotional Tears: https://bit.ly/41W71pl\nRevisiting the revisit: added evidence for a social chemosignal in human emotional tears: https://bit.ly/44dygNJ\nIncrease of tear volume in dogs after reunion with owners is mediated by oxytocin: https://bit.ly/41W73gX\nAn olfactory self-test effectively screens for COVID-19: https://go.nature.com/3Vj6z1S\n\nOther Resources\nJoachim L\u00f6w video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOstSv7SrRU \nOsmo: https://osmo.ai \nOdor Space: https://odorspace.weizmann.ac.il \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Noam Sobel\n00:03:46 Sponsors: ROKA, Thesis, Helix Sleep\n00:06:46 Olfaction Circuits (Smell)\n00:14:49 Loss & Regeneration of Smell, Illness\n00:21:39 Brain Processing of Smell\n00:24:40 Smell & Memories\n00:27:52 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:29:07 Humans & Odor Tracking\n00:39:25 The Alternating Nasal Cycle & Autonomic Nervous System\n00:48:18 Cognitive Processing & Breathing\n00:54:47 Neurodegenerative Diseases & Olfaction \n01:00:12 Congenital Anosmia\n01:05:01 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:06:19 Handshaking, Sharing Chemicals & Social Sensing\n01:15:07 Smelling Ourselves & Smelling Others \n01:22:02 Odors & Romantic Attraction\n01:24:58 Vomeronasal Organ, \u201cBruce Effect\u201d & Miscarriage\n01:40:20 Social Chemo-Signals, Fear\n01:50:26 Chemo-Signaling, Aggression & Offspring\n02:03:57 Menstrual Cycle Synchronization\n02:12:11 Sweat, Tears, Emotions & Testosterone\n02:27:46 Science Politics \n02:37:54 Food Odors & Nutritional Value\n02:45:34 Human Perception & Odorant Similarity \n02:52:12 Digitizing Smell, COVID-19 & Smell\n03:05:50 Medical Diagnostic Future & Olfaction Digitization\n03:10:55 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac -

I then present five key principles of mental visualization to enhance learning speed, accuracy, and consistency. I also provide examples of specific protocols, including repetitions, rest periods, and session frequency, and how to adapt these methods for injuries or breaks from traditional training. Throughout, I reference the scientific studies supporting these concepts.

He explains Neuralink\u2019s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink\u2019s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink\u2019s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Matthew MacDougall\nClinical Practice: https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-doctor/dr-matthew-macdougall \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmmacdougall\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/matthewmacdoug4 \nThe Institute: https://www.theinstitute.com/fellow/matthew-macdougall \n\nNeuralink\nNeuralink: https://neuralink.com \nNeuralink\u2019s Patient Registry: https://neuralink.com/patient-registry\nJoin Neuralink: https://neuralink.com/careers\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Matthew MacDougall\n00:04:05 Sponsors: HVMN, Levels, Thesis\n00:07:38 Brain Function & Injury; Brain Tumor Treatment\n00:13:52 Frontal Lobe Filter; Sleep Deprivation\n00:19:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology & Machines\n00:22:10 Neuralink, Neural Implants & Injury, Robotics & Surgery\n00:31:05 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:32:20 Neocortex vs. Deep Brain\n00:36:45 Decoding Brain Signals\n00:42:08 \u201cConfidence Test\u201d & Electrical Stimulation; RFID Implants\n00:51:33 Bluetooth Headphones & Electromagnetic Fields; Heat\n00:57:43 Brain Augmentation & Paralysis\n01:00:51 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:02:09 Brain Implants & Peripheral Devices\n01:12:44 Brain Machine Interface (BMI), Neurofeedback; Video Games\n01:22:13 Improving Animal Experimentation, Pigs\n01:33:18 Skull & Injury, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\n01:39:14 Brain Health, Alcohol\n01:43:34 Neuroplasticity, Brain Lesions & Redundancy \n01:47:32 Car Accidents & Driver Alertness\n01:50:00 Future Possibilities in Brain Augmentation & BMI; Neuralink \n01:58:56 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair \u201cdead\u201d (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress. This episode explains the mechanisms underlying hair regrowth tools and the science behind them so that you can evaluate potential treatments and associated side-effect profiles and select the best one(s) for you. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #HairGrowth\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hu.berman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nMicroneedling and Its Use in Hair Loss Disorders: A Systematic Review: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13555-021-00653-2\nCaffeine and Its Pharmacological Benefits in the Management of Androgenetic Alopecia: A Review: https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/508228\nThe effectiveness of combination therapies for androgenetic alopecia: A systematic review and meta-analysis: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dth.13741\nDifferential effects of caffeine on hair shaft elongation, matrix and outer root sheath keratinocyte proliferation, and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b22/insulin\u2010like growth factor\u20101\u2010mediated regulation of the hair cycle in male and female human hair follicles in vitro: https://academic.oup.com/bjd/article-abstract/171/5/1031/6616284?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false\nThe structure of people\u2019s hair: https://peerj.com/articles/619/\n\nNote: The Huberman Lab podcast has no affiliation with or financial benefit from any of the products listed below, which are provided as a useful reference only.\n\nKetoconazole Shampoos\nKeeps: https://www.keeps.com/our-products/ketoconazole \nNurx: https://www.nurx.com/topical/ketoconazole-2-shampoo/fb/ \nSiena Health: https://www.sienahealth.com/product/ketoconazole-shampoo-2 \nIntelligent: https://intelligent.shop/products/intelligent-shampoo\n\nBiotin Shampoos\nMaple Holisitics: https://www.amazon.com/Biotin-Hair-Shampoo-Thinning-Moisturizing/dp/B01ENCBOA0 \nOuai: https://theouai.com/collections/shampoo-conditioner/products/fine-hair-shampoo \nR+Co: https://www.randco.com/collections/dallas-collection/products/dallas-biotin-thickening-shampoo \n\nMicroneedling https://www.amazon.com/s?k=microneedling+hair+2mm&crid=OOD2YAB5CQXN&sprefix=microneedling+hair+2mm%2Caps%2C168&ref=nb_sb_noss \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Hair\n00:04:13 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, HVMN, ROKA\n00:08:04 Psychological States & Hair\n00:13:19 Hair Anatomy & Stem Cells\n00:26:05 3 Phases of Hair Growth\n00:35:40 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:55 Minoxidil & Blood Flow\n00:45:37 Increase Blood Flow: Massage, Tadalafil, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), Microneedling\n00:56:10 Microneedling, Minoxidil & \u201cDead Zones\u201d\n01:00:13 Sponsor: LMNT\n01:01:25 Botox Treatments\n01:06:27 Androgens, Hair Growth & Pattern Hair Loss;

She explains stress intervention tools using \u201ctop-down\u201d techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing), body-based methods (e.g., breathwork) including the Wim Hof Method, exercise, meditation, body scans, and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology, and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.

Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.\n\n#HubermanLab #Dopamine #Motivation \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nPain modulates dopamine neurons via a spinal\u2013parabrachial\u2013mesencephalic circuit: https://go.nature.com/3FPaFIH\nDopamine, Updated: Reward Prediction Error and Beyond: https://bit.ly/3Gha0A7\nHuman physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures: https://bit.ly/3IumXX1\nEffect of tyrosine on cognitive function and blood pressure under stress: https://bit.ly/3LSSHZq\nTyrosine Improves Working Memory in a Multitasking Environment: https://bit.ly/3LSgCZ6\n\nBooks\nDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence: https://amzn.to/3TIWfj2\n\nOther Resources\nNon-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNW_gerXa4P6-7EC4twzLBjR22rQYk3u\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dopamine\n00:02:32 Sponsors: Helix Sleep, WHOOP, ROKA, Momentous\n00:06:27 Dopamine Brain Circuits \n00:14:53 Goals & Addiction\n00:17:13 Dopamine Dynamics, \u201cWave Pool\u201d analogy\n00:20:28 Craving, Motivation, Pursuit & Reward Prediction Error\n00:28:26 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:29:40 Feedback Cues & Reward Contingent Learning, \u201cScoreboard\u201d\n00:37:40 Addiction; Pleasure & Pain Imbalance\n00:44:55 Dopamine Release & Addictive Substances/Behaviors\n00:50:43 Addiction Recovery, Binding Behaviors\n00:53:25 Tools: Maintain Baseline Dopamine Levels\n01:02:08 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:03:26 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure & Dopamine\n01:09:38 Prescriptions & Supplementation: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens\n01:18:58 Dopamine Trough Recovery, Postpartum Depression\n01:23:31 Dopamine Dynamics, \u201cDopamine Stacking\u201d; Intrinsic Motivation\n01:38:10 Making Effort the Reward, Growth Mindset\n01:41:49 Tool: Overcome Procrastination\n01:52:16 Tool: Meditation & Procrastination\n01:57:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

We discuss his lab\u2019s discovery that \u201ctime-restricted eating\u201d (TRE) aka intermittent fasting, is beneficial effects for metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.\n\n#HubermanLab #IntermittentFasting\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Satchin Panda\nSalk Institute: https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda \nPanda Lab: https://panda.salk.edu \nPublications: https://panda.salk.edu/publications \nSupport Dr. Panda\u2019s Research: https://panda.salk.edu/giving \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SatchinPanda\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/satchin.panda \n\nOther Resources\nMy Circadian Clock app: https://mycircadianclock.org \nOntime Health app: https://getontimehealth.com \n\nArticles\nRevival of light signalling in the postmortem mouse and human retina: https://go.nature.com/3ZWnGro\nCircadian alignment of early onset caloric restriction promotes longevity in male C57BL/6J mice: https://bit.ly/3ywruE3\nTime-restricted eating with or without low-carbohydrate diet reduces visceral fat and improves metabolic syndrome: A randomized trial: http://bit.ly/3LeBdqg\nEmbers of society: Firelight talk among the Ju/\u2019hoansi Bushmen: https://bit.ly/3l65LzK\nCircadian Entrainment to the Natural Light-Dark Cycle across Seasons and the Weekend: http://bit.ly/3LhsWlm\nFeasibility of time-restricted eating and impacts on cardiometabolic health in 24-h shift workers: The Healthy Heroes randomized control trial: http://bit.ly/3FeR1FC\nAccess to Electric Light Is Associated with Shorter Sleep Duration in a Traditionally Hunter-Gatherer Community: https://bit.ly/3LivSyj\nDaily Eating Patterns and Their Impact on Health and Disease: https://bit.ly/3YGIHW6\n\nBooks\nThe Circadian Code: https://amzn.to/3FixpAv\nThe Circadian Diabetes Code: https://amzn.to/3FiU7Zm\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Satchin Panda\n00:03:02 Sponsors: HVMN, Eight Sleep, Thesis, Momentous\n00:07:24 Time-Restricted Eating (TRE), Calorie Restriction (CR) & Health \n00:14:38 Mealtimes & Circadian Clock\n00:21:34 Circadian Rhythm, Meal Anticipation, Digestion\n00:25:28 Breaking a Fast, Burning Fat \n00:32:49 Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:34:04 CR, Time Restricted Eating, Circadian Rhythm & Longevity\n00:47:20 Gender, Hormones & CR;

I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water\u2019s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called \u201cpH water\u201d or \u201calkalized water\u201d to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one\u2019s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance.\n\nFor recommended water filters, tests and the full show notes, please visit https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-optimize-your-water-quality-and-intake-for-health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nImpact of cold exposure on life satisfaction and physical composition of soldiers: https://bit.ly/3kMxG7G\nCircadian rhythms and the kidney: https://go.nature.com/41RHUnV\nEndocrine Disruptors in Water and Their Effects on the Reproductive System: https://bit.ly/3L7rjXc\nImpact of Drinking Water Fluoride on Human Thyroid Hormones: A Case- Control Study: https://go.nature.com/3ZFoFfu\nRegulations for calcium, magnesium or hardness in drinking water in the European Union member states: https://bit.ly/3SOdnU4\nElectrolyzed-Reduced Water: Review I.

We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the \u201cheritability of acquired traits\u201d and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi\u2019s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nHVMN: https://hvmn.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Rechavi \nAcademic Profile: https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/profile/odedrech_66 \nLab Website: https://www.odedrechavilab.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/OdedRechavi \nTEDx Talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/oded_rechavi_transgenerational_biology?language=en  \n\nArticles\nNeuronal Small RNAs Control Behavior Transgenerationally: https://bit.ly/2HZxrzO\nTransgenerational Inheritance of an Acquired Small RNA-Based Antiviral Response in C. elegans: https://bit.ly/41xRf47\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Oded Rechavi\n00:02:08 Sponsors: ROKA, HVMN, Eight Sleep\n00:06:04 DNA, RNA, Protein; Somatic vs. Germ Cells\n00:14:36 Lamarckian Evolution, Inheritance of Acquired Traits\n00:22:54 Paul Kammerer & Toad Morphology\n00:28:52 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:30:06 James McConnell & Memory Transfer\n00:37:31 Weismann Barrier; Epigenetics \n00:45:13 Epigenetic Reprogramming; Imprinted Genes \n00:50:43 Nature vs. Nurture; Epigenetics & Offspring\n00:59:06 Generational Epigenetic Inheritance \n01:09:03 Sponsor: InsideTracker\n01:10:20 Model Organisms, C. elegans\n01:21:50 C. elegans & Inheritance of Acquired Traits, Small RNAs\n01:26:02 RNA Interference, C. elegans & Virus Immunity\n01:34:13 RNA Amplification, Multi-Generational Effects\n01:38:41 Response Duration & Environment\n01:47:50 Generational Memory Transmission, RNA\n01:59:36 Germ Cells & Behavior; Body Cues\n02:04:48 Transmission of Sexual Choice\n02:11:22 Fertility & Human Disease; 3-Parent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); RNA Testing\n02:17:56 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Learning & Memory\n02:29:26 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify & Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, \u201cWim Hof Method,\u201d Pr\u0101n\u0101y\u0101ma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why \u201coverbreathing\u201d is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups. Breathwork practices are zero-cost and require minimal time yet provide a unique and powerful avenue to improve overall quality of life that is grounded in clear physiology.

He explains the cellular mechanisms of muscle soreness and pain, why adequate recovery is essential for all physical adaptations, and how to enhance recovery using breathwork, thermal, movement, and pressure-based techniques. He describes how overtraining impedes exercise progress and how to assess if you are overreaching or overtraining, by using specific biomarkers and indicators. Like other performance metrics, recovery is a skill that can and should be trained, and that can be learned. This episode provides an actionable toolkit for how to monitor and improve your exercise recovery abilities, which will improve your overall mental and physical health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Recovery #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hu.berman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Andy Galpin\nAcademic Profile: http://hhd.fullerton.edu/knes/faculty...\nWebsite: https://www.andygalpin.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drandygalpin\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/drandygalpin\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3R2e3zYxWwIhMKV36Qhkw\n\nArticles\nBrief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal: https://bit.ly/3xleMHI\nAltered brown fat thermoregulation and enhanced cold-induced thermogenesis in young, healthy, winter-swimming men: https://bit.ly/3YuoDa4\n\nOther Resources\nCarbon Dioxide Tolerance Clip (Galpin Guest Series Episode 3): https://youtu.be/oNkDA2F7CjM \nSHIFT Breathwork Assessment: https://shiftadapt.com/breathwork\nBMJ tool for visualizing the variability of lab test results: https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m149/rapid-responses\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Recovery\n00:04:17 Exercise & Delayed Muscle Soreness, Pain\n00:11:35 Muscle Spindles, Reduce Soreness\n00:18:56 Exercise, Homeostasis & Hormesis; Blood Test & Fitness Level\n00:30:20 Recovery Timescales, Adaptation & Optimization\n00:35:10 Adaptation & Biomarkers Levels\n00:40:36 4 Recovery Levels, Enhance Recovery\n00:47:28 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:48:19 Overreaching vs. Overtraining\n00:52:53 Tool: Acute Overload & Recovery, Breathwork\n01:03:39 Tool: Alleviate Acute Soreness, Compression Clothing\n01:08:27 Tool: Acute Soreness, Massage, Temperature\n01:14:21 Cold & Heat Contrast, Cold Shower vs. Immersion, Sauna & Fertility\n01:20:44 InsideTracker\n01:21:46 Combine Recovery Techniques\n01:24:34 Monitoring for Overreaching & Overtraining\n01:31:33 Overreaching/Overtraining, Performance & Physiology, Sleep\n01:45:41 Overreaching/Overtraining, Biomarkers, Cortisol\n01:50:45 Cortisol, Daily Levels & Performance; Rhodiola Supplementation\n02:01:25 Carbohydrates, Cortisol & Sleep\n02:05:05 Tool: Stress Biomarkers, Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\n02:15:07 Tool: \u201cAcute State Shifters\u201d, Stimulants, Dopamine Stacking, Phones\n02:25:04 Mirrors & Resistance Training\n02:29:01 Tool: \u201cChronic State Shifters\u201d\n02:32:43 Training Recovery & Resilience; Bowling Alley Analogy\n02:39:45 Trigger Adaptations & Stress Recovery \n02:42:41 Tool: Measure Recovery; Blood Biomarkers\n02:50:06 Libido & Sex Hormones, Supplementation Caution\n03:00:08 Tools: No-/Low-Cost Recovery Measurements\n03:03:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes. Anyone wishing to improve their physical health and performance stands to benefit from the information.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Social & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Andy Galpin\nAcademic Profile: http://hhd.fullerton.edu/knes/facultystaff/AndyGalpin.php\nWebsite: https://www.andygalpin.com \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drandygalpin\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/drandygalpin\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3R2e3zYxWwIhMKV36Qhkw\n\nArticles\nExercise Snacks: A Novel Strategy to Improve Cardiometabolic Health: http://bit.ly/3Rp7UlP\nThe Effects of Acute Exercise on Mood, Cognition, Neurophysiology, and Neurochemical Pathways: A Review:  https://bit.ly/3HniYv5\n\nOther Resources\nExercise Snacks: https://beyond.ubc.ca/exercise-snacks\nSHIFT Breathing Gears: https://youtu.be/u8kxddDHj90\nSHIFT Breathing Assessment: https://shiftadapt.com/breathwork\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Endurance: Benefits, Mechanics & Breathing \n00:07:30 Tool: \u201cExercise Snacks\u201d\n00:14:21 Momentous, Levels, LMNT\n00:18:01 Endurance Categories\n00:22:16 Fat Loss & Respiration;

When most people hear about \u201csupplements,\u201d they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can\u2019t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss \u201cfoundational\u201d supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.\n\n#HubermanLab #Supplements #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nEurycoma longifolia (Jack) Improves Serum Total Testosterone in Men: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials: https://bit.ly/3QnuCdJ\n\nResources\nExamine: https://examine.com \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Supplements\n00:03:38 Hierarchy of Tools/Interventions, Developing a Supplementation Protocol\n00:11:51 Momentous, LMNT, Helix Sleep\n00:15:38 Role of Supplements, Foundational Supplements, Water/Fat-Soluble Vitamins\n00:21:07 Supplement Considerations: Cost, Nutrition & Schedule\n00:25:25 Foundational Supplements, Digestive Enzymes, Adaptogens\n00:28:04 Gut Microbiome, Probiotics/Prebiotics & Nutrition\n00:33:06 Supplements for Gut Microbiome, Brain Fog\n00:35:59 InsideTracker\n00:36:44 Adaptogens & Broad-Spectrum Foundational Supplements\n00:38:35 Core Supplement Questions & Meeting Foundational Needs\n00:43:45 Supplements to Support Sleep: Myo-Inositol, Theanine\n00:50:52 Supplements for Falling Asleep: Magnesium Threonate/Bisglycinate, Apigenin\n00:55:55 Melatonin Caution\n00:58:11 Supplement Dependency?, Placebo Effects\n01:02:45 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n01:03:53 Nutrition & Behavior for Hormone Health\n01:08:59 Hormone Health: Shilajit, Ashwagandha, L-Carnitine, Maca Root \n01:12:48 Growth Hormone: Behaviors, Arginine, Prescriptions \n01:16:04 Testosterone/Estrogen: Fadogia Agrestis; Bloodwork \n01:23:06 Testosterone Supplement: Tongkat Ali, Libido \n01:27:24 Menstrual Cycle, Birth Control & Fertility\n01:30:54 Cognitive Enhancement & Focus, Sleep, Stimulants: Caffeine \n01:36:57 Adrenaline & Stimulants: Yohimbine, Rauwolscine \n01:38:55 Adjusting Neurotransmitters: Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine; Layering Supplements\n01:43:58 Cognitive, Mood & Metabolic Support: Omega-3 Fatty Acids\n01:47:25 Food-Mimic Supplements, Protein \n01:50:09 Kids, Aging & Supplements\n01:55:25 A Rational Supplementation Protocol\n01:58:36 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding \u201cthe self\u201d and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one\u2019s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (\u201cchatter\u201d) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam\u2019s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.\n\n#HubermanLab #SamHarris #Meditation\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nWHOOP: https://join.whoop.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Special Offer for Waking Up\nhttps://www.wakingup.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Sam Harris\nWaking Up app: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMaking Sense podcast: https://www.samharris.org/podcasts \nWebsite: https://www.samharris.org \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/samharrisorg\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@samharrisorg\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Samharrisorg\n\nBooks\nWaking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion: https://amzn.to/3Z51pIb\nMaking Sense: Conversations on Consciousness, Morality, and the Future of Humanity: https://amzn.to/3CgbIQ3\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Sam Harris \n00:04:36 Levels, WHOOP, Eight Sleep, Momentous\n00:08:54 Sense of Self & Meditation, Dualism of Self\n00:18:07 Sense of Self in Brain & Body \n00:25:28 Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation\n00:28:25 Interrupting Sense of Self & Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade \n00:33:30 Observer & Actor, Default Mode Network & Meditation, Blind Spot\n00:40:48 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:41:57 Mediation & Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience\n00:57:32 Sense of Self throughout Evolution \n01:07:40 Sense of Self from Human Development, Language\n01:18:42 InsideTracker\n01:19:46 Internal Dialogue, Distractibility & Mindfulness \n01:26:27 Time Perception & Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance & Pain\n01:37:13 Consciousness & Sense of Control, Free Will\n01:43:14 Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling & Ideas, Free Will\n01:52:11 Meditation & the Paradoxical Search for Self\n02:06:44 Meditation & Concentration Practice \n02:11:58 Mindfulness, \u201cSkylike Mind\u201d & Thoughts\n02:15:11 States of Self & Context, Dualistic Experiences\n02:32:39 Distraction & Identification of Thoughts, Meditation & \u201cFlow\u201d States\n02:42:58 Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues & Social Interactions\n02:54:59 Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions\n03:05:58 Psychedelics, MDMA & Experiences in Consciousness, Religion\n03:21:11 Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys & Inner Truths\n03:29:48 Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution & Thought Expansion\n03:40:09 Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present\n03:54:29 Leaving Twitter;

We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how \u201cenergy\u201d actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity.  And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for \u2018detachment\u2019 as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.\n\n#HubermanLab #JockoWillink\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nJocko Willink\nExtreme Ownership book: https://amzn.to/3VtiUPw\nWay of the Warrior Kid book: https://amzn.to/3VwPIHC\nJocko Podcast: https://jockopodcast.com\nEchelon Front: https://echelonfront.com \nJocko's website: https://jocko.com \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jockowillink \nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/jockowillink \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jkowillink\n\nBooks\nOn The Psychology of Military Incompetence: https://amzn.to/46PnpcR\nMastery: https://amzn.to/3RCRk3R\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Jocko Willink\n00:03:50 Maui Nui Venison, Eight Sleep, LMNT, Momentous\n00:08:42 Sense of Self, Discovery & Autonomy\n00:19:11 Mindsets in the Military: Garrison vs. Combat\n00:25:02 Military Divisions\n00:29:34 Daily Workouts & Discipline\n00:35:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:53 Energy & Movement, Cortisol, Nutrition\n00:52:10 Exercise & Energy, Deliberate Cold Exposure\n00:59:05 Win vs. Loss Mindset, Leadership, Action & Energy \n01:12:07 InsideTracker\n01:13:11 Confidence, Generators vs. Projectors, Family\n01:24:01 Restoring Motivation: Social Connection & Play\n01:32:44 Self-Identity & Context, Alcohol, Music, Dopamine\n01:45:10 Motivation Sources & Recovering from Loss\n01:54:05 Suicide, Navy SEALs, Social Contagion\n02:09:00 Suicide, Alcohol, Positive Action \n02:15:03 Meditation, Detachment\n02:20:30 Adaptability & Opportunities, Navy SEALs \n02:30:43 Ambition & Love, Likeability, Leadership\n02:40:18 Building Teams, Detachment, Family\n02:50:20 Detachment: Problems & Perspective\n02:55:55 Tools: Strategies to Detach from Situation\n03:08:31 Tool: Situational Awareness & Detachment\n03:17:49 Social Media, Personal Flaws\n03:23:01 Falling Asleep & Detachment\n03:27:02 Resilience Calibration, Navy SEAL Training & Combat\n03:39:16 Deliberate Discomfort & Mental Resilience\n03:42:21 People & Animals, Personalities\n03:51:25 Political Leadership & Military, Social Media\n04:01:38 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.\n\n#HubermanLab #Creativity #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nOpen monitoring meditation reduces the involvement of brain regions related to memory function: https://go.nature.com/3V6s6Jt\nThe (b)link between creativity and dopamine: Spontaneous eye blink rates predict and dissociate divergent and convergent thinking: https://bit.ly/3v3nlWG\nIncreased dopamine tone during meditation-induced change of consciousness: https://bit.ly/3PJATjC\nExploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open-label natural setting: https://bit.ly/3FHf3Zv\nA new method for training creativity: narrative as an alternative to divergent thinking: https://bit.ly/3FH0chB\nMore creative through positive mood?

We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali, fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss, and prostate health, and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally. Dr. Gillett offers numerous actionable tools that can be tailored to specific goals and age ranges to attain and maintain optimal levels of male hormones for overall health, well-being and longevity. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Hormones \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Kyle Gillet\nDr. Gillett\u2019s clinic: https://gilletthealth.com \nGillet Health YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@gilletthealth6738\nThe Gillet Health Podcast on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3Bu13kh\nThe Gillet Health Podcast on Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3FJSCUz\nInstagram: https://www.Instagram.com/kylegillettmd\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gilletthealth \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Kyle Gillett & Male Hormone Optimization\n00:03:40 Thesis, ROKA, Helix Sleep, Momentous\n00:07:43 Puberty: Height, Resistance Training, Childhood Obesity\n00:15:14 \u201cFirst\u201d vs. \u201cSecond\u201d Puberty\n00:17:17 Hormone Optimization & Blood Work\n00:22:14 Diet, Exercise, Sleep & Hormones\n00:28:23 Hormones, Stress, Social Connection & Purpose\n00:32:19 Hormones, Supplementation & Medication\n00:34:08 Determining Individual Hormone Levels, ADAM Questionnaire\n00:40:35 Libido, Masturbation, Pornography & the Dopamine \u201cWave Pool\u201d\n00:48:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:49:46 Sustainable Exercise Regimen for Hormone Health\n00:58:12 Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)\n01:01:02 Supplementation: Creatine & Hair Loss, Betaine, L-Carnitine & Allicin (Garlic)\n01:11:45 Vitamin D, Boron; SHBG & Free Testosterone\n01:15:34 InsideTracker\n01:16:39 Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia; Longjack) & Steroid Pathways\n01:22:09 Fadogia Agrestis & Testosterone \n01:26:32 Optimize Growth Hormone & IGF-1: Diet, Fasting, Supplements & Exercise \n01:31:52 Optimize Thyroid Hormone: Iodine & Goitrogens\n01:33:56 Peptides: Growth Hormone, Tesamorelin, Ibutamoren & Gut Microbiome\n01:42:06 Testosterone Therapy\n01:47:03 Prescriptions & Hormones: Human Choriogonadotropin (HCG), Clomiphene\n01:52:56 Testosterone Therapy + HCG, Fertility & Temperature\n01:55:30 Hormone Health Q&A: Marijuana, Nicotine, Cycling, Pelvic Floor, Alcohol, Fat\n02:06:08 Prostate Health & Tadalafil, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)\n02:09:56 Hair Loss & DHT; Turmeric & Curcuminoids\n02:18:13 BPAs, Phthalates & Hormone Health\n02:21:55 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks\u2014thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine. Since caffeine is one of the most commonly used substances (more than 90% of adults use caffeine daily!), this episode provides actionable tips for adjusting caffeine consumption to positively impact performance and health, including sleep. \n\n#HubermanLab #Caffeine #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nAnti-diabetic effects of GLP1 analogs are mediated by thermogenic interleukin-6 signaling in adipocytes: https://bit.ly/3Vy58Mi\nCaffeine in Floral Nectar Enhances a Pollinator's Memory of Reward: https://bit.ly/3XZ7Yf9\nConsumption of caffeinated beverages and serum concentrations of sex steroid hormones in US men: https://bit.ly/3Y94kPZ\nInverse association between caffeine intake and depressive symptoms in US adults: data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006: https://bit.ly/3XVB7I1\nCaffeine stimulation of cortisol secretion across the waking hours in relation to caffeine intake levels: https://bit.ly/3iAS5eH\nTime course of tolerance to the performance benefits of caffeine: https://bit.ly/3F4kGjN\nCaffeine consumption and menstrual function: https://bit.ly/3F1pBlM\nErgogenic effects of caffeine on peak aerobic cycling power during the menstrual cycle: https://bit.ly/3B819xX\nConsolidating Memories: https://bit.ly/3UEudUQ\nBlood dopamine level enhanced by caffeine in men after treadmill running: https://bit.ly/3HrqKpJ\nThe neuroprotective effects of caffeine in neurodegenerative diseases: https://bit.ly/3Ha3kER\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Caffeine\n00:02:58 Tool: GLP-1, Yerba Mate, Satiety & Weight Loss\n00:11:06 Levels, Eight Sleep, ROKA, Momentous Supplements\n00:15:23 Caffeine Benefits for Mental & Physical Performance\n00:20:23 Caffeine in Nature & Positive Reinforcement\n00:26:44 Caffeine Effects on Brain;

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer\u2019s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/Huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Chris Palmer\nDr. Palmer\u2019s website: https://www.chrispalmermd.com \nBrain Energy: A Revolutionary Breakthrough in Understanding Mental Health--and Improving Treatment for Anxiety, Depression, OCD, PTSD, and More: https://amzn.to/3XheFIV\nMedical profile: https://www.mcleanhospital.org/profile/christopher-palmer \nAcademic profile & publications: https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/70255\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ChrisPalmerMD\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrispalmermd\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Chris Palmer, Mental Health & Metabolic Disorders\n00:03:25 Thesis, Eight Sleep, ROKA\n00:07:18 Nutrition & Mental Health\n00:20:43 Low-Carb Diets & Anti-Depression, Fasting, Ketosis\n00:27:52 Schizophrenia, Depression & Ketogenic Diet\n00:34:32 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:35:38 Psychiatric Mediations, Diet Adherence\n00:42:35 Highly Processed Foods, Ketones & Mental Health Benefits\n00:46:51 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy Treatment\n00:56:10 Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria Health\n00:57:05 Nutrition & Benefits for Neurologic/Psychiatric Disorders\n01:05:44 Mitochondrial Function & Mental Health\n01:15:12 InsideTracker\n01:16:23 Mitophagy, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Aging & Diet\n01:25:09 Neurons, Mitochondria & Blood Glucose\n01:31:54 Obesity, Ketogenic Diet & Mitochondria\n01:40:00 Mitochondrial Function: Inheritance, Risk Factors, Marijuana \n01:46:34 Alcohol & Ketogenic Diet\n01:55:21 Brain Imaging, Alzheimer\u2019s Disease & Ketones\n02:01:05 Exogenous (Liquid) Ketones vs. Ketogenic Diet\n02:06:27 Neuronal Damage, Ketones & Glucose \n02:10:16 Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Age-Related Cognitive Decline & Ketogenic Diet\n02:23:45 Ketogenic Diet & Weight Loss\n02:35:47 Ketogenic Diet & Fasting, Hypomania, Sleep\n02:46:37 Low Carbohydrate Diets, Menstrual Cycles, Fertility\n02:52:23 Obesity Epidemic, Semaglutide & GLP-1 Medications \n03:01:01 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

While it is difficult to standardize happiness from one person to the next, I outline a structured framework of what is critical to increasing your innate \u201cnatural happiness,\u201d including financial security, purposeful work and relationships, and I explain specific tools to increase internal happiness (so-called \u201csynthetic happiness\u201d). I review how specific types of human connection and attention to our choices (or lack thereof) can increase or undermine our level of happiness. I also discuss the importance of certain types of physical contact, gratitude, financial choices and volunteer contributions that research shows can maximize happiness. And I discuss how factors such as children, pets, physical well-being, substance use, prior traumas and life-phase milestones affect our quest for and depth of happiness.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAthletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nSpending Money on Others Promotes Happiness: http://bit.ly/3X3k71V\nA Wandering Mind Is an Unhappy Mind: https://bit.ly/3sMP64B\nEye contact marks the rise and fall of shared attention in conversation: http://bit.ly/3hy04IF\nThe Influence of Interactions with Dogs on Affect, Anxiety, and Arousal in Children: http://bit.ly/3htjBdh\n\nBooks\nDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence: https://amzn.to/3A9S4UY\nThe Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity\u2015and Will Determine the Fate of the Human Race: https://amzn.to/3E3Und5\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Happiness\n00:06:27 Tool: Light Exposure Timing & Brightness Timing\n00:14:14 Thesis, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep\n00:17:51 Imprecise Language for Happiness\n00:20:26 Happiness: Neuromodulators & Neurotransmitters \n00:26:32 Harvard Happiness Project \n00:29:22 Income & Happiness; Social Interactions & Peer Group \n00:37:20 Work, Sense of Meaning & Happiness\n00:40:13 Toolkit for General Wellbeing\n00:43:06 Happiness Across the Lifespan, Does Having Children Make Us Happier?\n00:47:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:50:20 Birthdays & Evaluated Happiness\n00:52:45 Smoking, Alcohol & Happiness\n00:54:23 Trauma & Happiness, Lottery Winner vs. Paraplegic Accident\n01:05:05 Synthesizing Happiness\n01:09:18 Natural Happiness & Synthetic Happiness; Music\n01:13:45 Tool: Synthesizing Happiness: Effort, Environment & Gratitude\n01:24:50 Tool: Pro-Social Spending/Effort, Happiness\n01:31:55 Tool: Focus, Wandering Mind & Meditation \n01:39:40 Tool: Quality Social Connection\n01:41:28 Brief Social Connection, Facial Recognition & Predictability\n01:46:33 Deep Social Connection, Presence & Eye Contact\n01:54:00 Physical Contact & Social Connection, Allogrooming, Pets\n02:03:00 Freedom & Choice; Synthetic Happiness\n02:11:57 Happiness Toolkit\n02:22:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the \u201cthird-eye center,\u201d what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability.

We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying speech, language learning and comprehension, communicating human emotion with words and hand gestures, bilingualism and language disorders, such as stuttering. Dr. Chang also explains his work developing and applying state-of-the-art technology to decode speech and using that information and artificial intelligence (AI) to successfully restore communication to patients who have suffered paralyzing injuries or \u201clocked in syndrome.\u201d We also discuss his work treating patients with epilepsy. Finally, we consider the future: how modern neuroscience is overturning textbook medical books, the impact of digital technology such as smartphones on language and the future of natural and computer-assisted human communication. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://www.levelshealth.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Eddie Chang\nSupport research in the Chang Laboratory: https://changlab.ucsf.edu/support-our-work\nDr. Chang\u2019s lab: https://changlab.ucsf.edu \nAcademic profile & publications: https://profiles.ucsf.edu/edward.chang \nUCSF clinical profile: https://www.ucsfhealth.org/providers/dr-edward-chang \n\nArticles\nNeuroprosthesis for Decoding Speech in a Paralyzed Person with Anarthria: https://bit.ly/3sjv5Cx\n\nArticles in the News\nTapping Into the Brain to Help a Paralyzed Man Speak: https://nyti.ms/3f0AM5c\nHow Brain-Computer Interfaces Could Restore Speech and Help Fight Depression: https://on.wsj.com/3f1iBMH\nDecoded Brain Signals Could Give Voiceless People A Way To Talk: https://n.pr/3gujhdP\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Eddie Chang, Speech & Language \n00:03:00 Levels, Eight Sleep, InsideTracker, Momentous Supplements\n00:07:19 Neuroplasticity, Learning of Speech & Environmental Sounds\n00:13:10 White Noise Machines, Infant Sleep & Sensitization\n00:17:26 Mapping Speech & Language in the Brain\n00:24:26 Emotion; Anxiety & Epilepsy \n00:30:19 Epilepsy, Medications & Neurosurgery \n00:33:01 Ketogenic Diet & Epilepsy\n00:34:56 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:36:10 Absence Seizures, Nocturnal Seizures & Other Seizure Types\n00:41:08 Brain Areas for Speech & Language, Broca\u2019s & Wernicke\u2019s Areas, New Findings\n00:53:23 Lateralization of Speech/Language & Handedness, Strokes\n00:59:05 Bilingualism, Shared Language Circuits\n01:01:18 Speech vs. Language, Signal Transduction from Ear to Brain\n01:12:38 Shaping Breath: Larynx, Vocal Folds & Pharynx; Vocalizations\n01:17:37 Mapping Language in the Brain\n01:20:26 Plosives & Consonant Clusters; Learning Multiple Languages \n01:25:07 Motor Patterns of Speech & Language\n01:28:33 Reading & Writing; Dyslexia & Treatments\n01:34:47 Evolution of Language \n01:37:54 Stroke & Foreign Accent Syndrome\n01:40:31 Auditory Memory, Long-Term Motor Memory \n01:45:26 Paralysis, ALS, \u201cLocked-In Syndrome\u201d & Brain Computer Interface (BCI)\n02:02:14 Neuralink, BCI, Superhuman Skills & Augmentation\n02:10:21 Non-Verbal Communication, Facial Expressions, BCI & Avatars\n02:17:35 Stutter, Anxiety & Treatment \n02:22:55 Tools: Practices for Maintaining Calm Under Extreme Demands\n02:31:10 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nHuberman Lab is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health. This episode provides a modifiable \u201cfoundational\u201d template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment. \n\n#HubermanLab #Fitness #Exercise\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nA potent physiological method to magnify and sustain soleus oxidative metabolism improves glucose and lipid regulation: https://bit.ly/3yKcinr\nSkeletal Muscle Hypertrophy with Concurrent Exercise Training: Contrary Evidence for an Interference Effect: https://bit.ly/3VquEDL\n\nBooks\nRelax into Stretch: Instant Flexibility Through Mastering Muscle Tension: https://amzn.to/2D22cR9\n\nOther Resources\nDr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Strength, Muscle Size & Endurance: https://bit.ly/3D2ifP5\nJeff Cavaliere: Optimize Your Exercise Program with Science-Based Tools: https://bit.ly/3ELv0Pe\nDr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity: https://bit.ly/3ggkB3K\nATHLEAN-X: https://athleanx.com\nATHLEAN-X Neck Training: https://youtu.be/wjiZaCJ6tCA\nAnna Skips: https://www.instagram.com/anna.skips\n10-minute Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol: https://youtu.be/AKGrmY8OSHM\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Foundational Protocol for Fitness\n00:03:35 Huberman Lab Premium\n00:04:35 Tool: Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups, Glucose Utilization & Metabolism\n00:14:42 InsideTracker, ROKA, Helix Sleep, Momentous Supplements\n00:18:53 Core Principles of Fitness & Modifiable Variables\n00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout\n00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy\n00:38:09 Key Principles of Resistance Training\n00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery\n00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training\n01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives\n01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate\n01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training\n01:27:30 Flexibility of Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing\n01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs \n01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts\n01:37:18 Tool: Stress or Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR\n01:40:04 Should You Train Fasted or Fed?\n01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training\n01:47:56 Tool: Hanging from a Bar & Fitness Metric \n01:49:02 Should You Train Sick?, Ramping Training\n01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery\n01:53:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media\n\nDisclaimer: https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1Ss8sTbFBY/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1Ss8sTbFBY/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1Ss8sTbFBY/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1Ss8sTbFBY/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q1Ss8sTbFBY/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Andrew Huberman", "playlistId": "UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg", "position": 104, "resourceId": {"kind": "youtube#video", "videoId": "q1Ss8sTbFBY"}, "videoOwnerChannelTitle": "Andrew Huberman", "videoOwnerChannelId": "UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg"}, "contentDetails": {"videoId": "q1Ss8sTbFBY", "videoPublishedAt": "2022-10-17T12:00:37Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#playlistItem", "etag": "5obAEz1ImEBTr9FVnVxxlx_NaGI", "id": "VVUyRDJDTVdYTU9WV3g3Z2lXMW4zTElnLlg0UUU2dC1Na1lF", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2022-10-10T12:00:18Z", "channelId": "UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg", "title": "Dr. Nolan Williams: Psychedelics & Neurostimulation for Brain Rewiring | Huberman Lab Podcast #93", "description": "In this episode, my guest is Nolan Williams, M.D., a triple board-certified psychiatrist, neurologist and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams\u2019 work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams\u2019 knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.\n\n#HubermanLab #Science\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Nolan Williams\nStanford Profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/nolan-williams\nBrain Stimulation Lab: https://bsl.stanford.edu\nPublications: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i4WyrcYAAAAJ&hl=en\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nolanrywilliams\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nolan-williams-0802a324\n\nArticles\nAdjunctive triple chronotherapy (combined total sleep deprivation, sleep phase advance, and bright light therapy) rapidly improves mood and suicidality in suicidal depressed inpatients: An open label pilot study: https://bit.ly/3CJCWiv\nDevelopment of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse: https://bit.ly/3fJPjSI\n\nBooks\nBreaking Open the Head: https://amzn.to/3fVqbIG\n\nOther Resources\nBrain Stimulation Lab \u2013 Ongoing & Upcoming Studies: https://bsl.stanford.edu/clinical-trials\nMagnus Medical: https://www.magnusmed.com \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Nolan Williams, Brain Stimulation & Depression Treatment\n00:03:31 Huberman Lab Premium \n00:04:42 InsideTracker, Eight Sleep, ROKA\n00:08:37 Momentous Supplements \n00:09:16 Depression, Risk Factors, Emergency Psychiatric Treatments\n00:15:11 The Brain-Heart Connection, Vagus Nerve, Prefrontal Cortex\n00:17:51 Right vs. Left Brain Hemispheres & Mood Balance, Connectome\n00:22:34 Heart Rate & Depression, Behavioral Interventions, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)\n00:33:02 Prefrontal Cortex & Cognitive Control, TMS\n00:37:46 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:39:00 Belief/Identity \u201cRules\u201d, Re-scripting, TMS & Talk Therapy\n00:45:49 Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, TMS & Depression Treatment\n00:48:36 Cingulate Cortex & Emotion, Dissociation & Catatonia \n00:54:27 Ketamine, the Opioid System & Depression;

I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one\u2019s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Health\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nInspired by Mary Jane?

Dr. Halpern\u2019s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions. This episode will interest those curious about the biology of eating, anorexia, bulimia, compulsive thoughts and behaviors, and movement. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman \nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Casey Halpern\nPenn Medicine Profile: https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/casey-halpern \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/halpernc \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-halpern-a1569749 \nResponsive Neurostimulation For Loss Of Control Eating (DBSLOC) Study: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03868670\n\nArticles\nPilot study of responsive nucleus accumbens deep brain stimulation for loss-of-control eating: https://go.nature.com/3Sc1ZA1\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Casey Halpern & Disordered Eating & Brain Stimulation\n00:03:18 ROKA, Eight Sleep, InsideTracker\n00:07:19 Momentous Supplements \n00:08:28 Neurosurgeon\u2019s View of the Brain, Neurosurgery Specialization \n00:13:05 Deep Brain Stimulation & Other Unexpected Positive Effects \n00:17:20 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Prescriptions & Cognitive Therapies \n00:25:40 Brain Areas in OCD, Risk, Rewards & Addiction\n00:31:11 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:32:27 Facial and Vocal Ticks, Stimulants, Stress & Superstition\n00:39:28 Nucleus Accumbens, Reward Circuits, Eating Disorders & Obesity \n00:47:18 Stimulation of Nucleus Accumbens, Continuous vs. Episodic Stimulation\n00:49:49 Binge Eating Disorder & Loss of Control Eating\n00:53:02 Developing Binge Eating Disorder: Predisposition, Environment, Stress \n01:02:07 Electrodes in Nucleus Accumbens, Identifying \u201cCraving Cells\u201d\n01:11:41 Effects of Stimulation, Interrupting Craving, Intermediate Stimulation \n01:16:46 Anorexia, Obesity & Compulsions, Potential Treatments for Anorexia\n01:23:14 Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\n01:32:27 MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound: Tremor, Essential Tremor & Parkinson\u2019s\n01:36:40 Future of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation, Epilepsy & Depression\n01:41:51 Pre-Behavioral States in Compulsion & Awareness, Mood Provocation\n01:48:02 Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence & Compulsion Predictions\n01:53:05 Neurosurgeon Hands, Resistance Training & Deadlifts \n01:59:00 \u201cNeurosurgeon Calm,\u201d Quality Time & Prioritization, Neurosurgeon Training \n02:09:53 Daily Habits: Sleep, Exercise, Mediation\n02:11:59  Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about mental health, human emotions, sexual and/or violent behavior.  \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. David Anderson\nDr. David Anderson: https://davidandersonlab.caltech.edu/davidanderson \nThe Nature of the Beast: https://amzn.to/3qsrdOH\nDr. David Anderson\u2019s Lab: https://davidandersonlab.caltech.edu \nDr. Anderson\u2019s publications: https://bit.ly/3L5uGMl\n\nArticles\nTwo Different Forms of Arousal in Drosophila Are Oppositely Regulated by the Dopamine D1 Receptor Ortholog DopR via Distinct Neural Circuits: https://bit.ly/3Dmyh7b\n\nResources\nMouse switching from mating behavior to aggressive behaviors upon stimulation of VMH: https://youtu.be/AIlp69kfqjw?t=882 \nVMH stimulation causes mouse to display aggressive behaviors toward an inanimate object (e.g., glove): https://youtu.be/AIlp69kfqjw?t=689\nPicture of Periaqueductal Gray (PAG): https://neuroscientificallychallenged.com/posts/know-your-brain-periaqueductal-gray\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. David Anderson, Emotions & Aggression \n00:03:33 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:27 Levels, Helix Sleep, LMNT \n00:08:10 Emotions vs. States\n00:10:36 Dimensions of States: Persistence, Intensity & Generalization\n00:14:38 Arousal & Valence \n00:18:11 Aggression, Optogenetics & Stimulating Aggression in Mice, VMH\n00:24:42 Aggression Types: Offensive, Defensive & Predatory \n00:29:20 Evolution & Development of Defensive vs. Offensive Behaviors, Fear\n00:35:38 Hydraulic Pressures for States & Homeostasis\n00:38:33 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:39:46 Hydraulic Pressure & Aggression\n00:44:50 Balancing Fear & Aggression\n00:48:31 Aggression & Hormones: Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone\n00:52:33 Female Aggression, Motherhood\n00:59:48 Mating & Aggressive Behaviors \n01:05:10 Neurobiology of Sexual Fetishes \n01:10:06 Temperature, Mating Behavior & Aggression\n01:15:25 Mounting: Sexual Behavior or Dominance?\n01:20:59 Females & Male-Type Mounting Behavior\n01:24:40 PAG (Periaqueductal Gray) Brain Region: Pain Modulation & Fear \n01:30:38 Tachykinins & Social Isolation: Anxiety, Fear & Aggression \n01:43:49 Brain, Body & Emotions; Somatic Marker Hypothesis & Vagus Nerve \n01:52:52 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term.

Dr. Jarvis' research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stutter/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone interested in the origins of human speech, language, music and culture and how newer technology, such as social media and texting, change our brains.\n\n#HubermanLab #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman  \nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-hu...\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Erich Jarvis\nDr. Erick Jarvis' Lab: https://www.jarvislab.net \nRockefeller University: https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/heads-of-laboratories/1159-erich-d-jarvis\nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cI-fi9MAAAAJ\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/erichjarvis\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/erich_d_jarvis\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/erich-jarvis-ba73624\n\nOther Resources:\nEarth Biogenome Project: https://www.earthbiogenome.org \nGenomeArk: https://vgp.github.io/genomeark\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Erich Jarvis & Vocal Communication\n00:03:43 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:36 InsideTracker, ROKA, LMNT \n00:08:01 Speech vs. Language, Is There a Difference?  \n00:10:55 Animal Communication, Hand Gestures & Language \n00:15:25 Vocalization & Innate Language, Evolution of Modern Language    \n00:21:10 Humans & Songbirds, Critical Periods, Genetics, Speech Disorders \n00:27:11 Innate Predisposition to Learn Language, Cultural Hybridization\n00:31:34 Genes for Speech & Language\n00:35:49 Learning New or Multiple Languages, Critical Periods, Phonemes \n00:41:39 AG1 (Athletic Greens) \n00:42:52 Semantic vs. Effective Communication, Emotion, Singing\n00:47:32 Singing, Link Between Dancing & Vocal Learning \n00:52:55 Motor Theory of Vocal Learning, Dance \n00:55:03 Music & Dance, Emotional Bonding, Genetic Predispositions\n01:04:11 Facial Expressions & Language, Innate Expressions\n01:09:35 Reading & Writing \n01:15:13 Writing by Hand vs. Typing, Thoughts & Writing\n01:20:58 Stutter, Neurogenetics, Overcome Stutter, Conversations\n01:26:58 Modern Language Evolution: Texting, Social Media & the Future\n01:36:26 Movement: The Link to Cognitive Growth \n01:40:21 Comparative Genomics, Earth Biogenome Project, Genome Ark, Conservation\n01:48:24 Evolution of Skin & Fur Color\n01:51:22 Dr. Erich Jarvis, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior \u2013 hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals. \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticles\nAssociations between alcohol consumption and gray and white matter volumes in the UK Biobank: https://go.nature.com/3PNFj7y\nGut Microbiota at the Intersection of Alcohol, Brain, and the Liver: https://bit.ly/3AaeF2F\nTolerance to alcohol: A critical yet understudied factor in alcohol addiction: https://bit.ly/3CmfCYo\nAssociations Between Drinking and Cortical Thickness in Younger Adult Drinkers: Findings From the Human Connectome Project: https://bit.ly/3AeUosJ\nModerate Alcohol Consumption and the Risk of Breast Cancer: https://bit.ly/3PHlJcK\nCan alcohol promote aromatization of androgens to estrogens?

Dr. Attia is host of The Drive podcast and is a world expert on behavioral approaches, nutritional interventions, supplementation and pharmacological techniques to improve lifespan, healthspan and athletic performance. We discuss how best to evaluate your health status using routine blood work, body scans and regular tests of physical strength and endurance. Dr. Attia explains what he uses with his patients to \u201cback-cast\u201d their health goals as a way to design their exercise and nutritional programs. We also discuss hormone modulation and replacement therapy for both men and women. We explain how cholesterol and related factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk and how to monitor and mitigate that risk. Dr. Attia details various supplementation, nutrition, exercise and prescription approaches useful to people in every decade of life to improve vitality, reduce their risk of disease and increase the number of years sustaining peak cognitive and physical health. \n\n#HubermanLab #PeterAttia #Longevity \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman  \nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman  \n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Peter Attia\nWebsite: https://peterattiamd.com \nThe Peter Attia Drive Podcast: https://peterattiamd.com/podcast \nNewsletter: https://peterattiamd.com/newsletter \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/peterattiamd \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterAttiaMD\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/peterattiamd\n\nArticles\nStrength & longevity: https://peterattiamd.com/ama27\nVO2 max & longevity: https://peterattiamd.com/how-does-vo2-max-correlate-with-longevity\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Assessing Health Status & Improving Vitality \n00:02:51 Momentous Supplements \n00:03:46 Thesis, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep \n00:07:29 Lifespan: Bloodwork & Biomarkers Testing, The \u201c4 Horseman of Disease\u201d \n00:11:51 Healthspan: Functional Testing, Cognitive & Emotional States \n00:13:59 Blood Testing: Best Frequency \n00:16:01 DEXA Scan: Lean Mass & Fat, Bone Mineral Density & Osteoporosis \n00:22:33 Bone Mineral Density & Age-Related Decline, Strength Training, Corticosteroids \n00:29:24 Osteopenia & Osteoporosis Diagnosis, Strength Training\n00:31:03 AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n00:32:16 Back-casting: Defining Your \u201cMarginal Decade\u201d \n00:38:31 All-Cause Mortality: Smoking, Strength, VO2 max \n00:44:43 Attia\u2019s Rule of Supplementation, \u201cCentenarian Decathlete\u201d Physical Goals\n00:49:24 Importance of Exercise, Brain Health, MET hours \n00:55:23 Nicotine & Cognitive Focus\n01:03:12 Menstruation, PMS & Menopause \n01:10:10 Hormone Replacement Therapy, Menopause & Breast Cancer Risk\n01:22:06 Estrogen, Progesterone & Testosterone Therapies in Women\n01:26:35 Hormone Replacement Therapy in Men, SHBG & Testosterone, Insulin\n01:37:23 Clomid, Pituitary, Testosterone & Cholesterol, Anastrozole, HCG\n01:47:46 Fadogia Agrestis, Supplements, Rapamycin \n01:52:06 Testosterone Replacement Therapy & Fertility \n01:59:26 Total Testosterone vs. Free Testosterone\n02:02:51 Cholesterol & Dietary Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, LDL & HDL, Apolipoprotein B\n02:17:42 Apolipoprotein B, Diet, Statins & Other Cholesterol Prescriptions \n02:25:15 Cardiovascular Disease, Age & Disease Risk \n02:28:53 Peptides, Stem Cells, BPC157, PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma), Injury Rehabilitation \n02:37:40 Metabolomics & Exercise \n02:40:44 GLP-1 & Weight Loss \n02:47:06 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.\u2019 I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood. \n\n#HubermanLab #Bipolar #BipolarDisorder\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nBlinkist: https://www.blinkist.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nFull show notes & links to peer-reviewed articles: https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Bipolar Disorder \n00:02:23 Momentous Supplements \n00:03:42 Tool: Appetite Suppression & GLP-1, Parallel Pathways, Yerba Mate\n00:10:23 InsideTracker, ROKA, Blinkist\n00:14:24 Prevalence & Severity of Bipolar Disorder\n00:16:30 Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria of Mania \n00:28:58 Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability \n00:33:07 Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive & Symptom-Free States\n00:38:20 Consequences of Bipolar Disorder, Heritability\n00:46:53 Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder\n00:51:51 Mania & Depression, Negative Impacts \n00:53:06 History of Lithium Treatment \n01:02:44 Lithium Treatment & Side-Effects\n01:05:05 Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory & Neuroprotection\n01:10:10 Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity\n01:17:11 Neural States & Mania, Parietal Lobe & Limbic System\n01:22:58 Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium & Ketamine\n01:36:00 Talk Therapies: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal & Social Rhythm Therapy \n01:43:18 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) \n01:48:01 Psylocibin, Cannabis \n01:51:50 Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol & Omega-3 Fatty Acids \n02:03:31 Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity & Neuroplasticity \n02:06:44 Mania, Creativity & Occupations \n02:15:33 Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis, Neural Circuits & Treatment\n02:17:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

We discuss the neural circuits of taste,  the \u201cgut-brain axis,\u201d the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.\n\n#HubermanLab #Sugar #Taste \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nDr. Charles Zuker\nColumbia Zuckerman Institute: https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/charles-s-zuker-phd \nLab website: https://www.zukerlab.com \nHoward Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) profile: https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/charles-s-zuker \n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Dr. Charles Zuker & Taste Perception \n00:03:05 Momentous Supplements \n00:04:35 Thesis, ROKA, Helix Sleep\n00:08:35 Sensory Detection vs. Sensory Perception \n00:11:48 Individual Variations within Perception, Color\n00:16:20 Perceptions & Behaviors \n00:20:19 The 5 Taste Modalities \n00:26:18 Aversive Taste, Bitter Taste \n00:28:00 Survival-Based & Evolutionary Reasons for Taste Modalities, Taste vs. Flavor\n00:30:14 Additional Taste Modalities: Fat & Metallic Perception \n00:34:02 Tongue \u201cTaste Map,\u201d Taste Buds & Taste Receptors  \n00:39:34 Burning Your Tongue & Perception\n00:42:54 The \u201cMeaning\u201d of Taste Stimuli, Sweet vs. Bitter, Valence \n00:51:55 Positive vs. Negative Neuronal Activation & Behavior \n00:56:16 Acquired Tastes, Conditioned Taste Aversion  \n01:01:44 Olfaction (Smell) vs. Taste, Changing Tastes over One\u2019s Lifetime\n01:09:14 Integration of Odor & Taste, Influence on Behavior & Emotion \n01:17:26 Sensitization to Taste, Internal State Modulation, Salt\n01:24:05 Taste & Saliva: The Absence of Taste\n01:28:10 Sugar & Reward Pleasure Centers; Gut-Brain Axis, Anticipatory Response\n01:36:23 Vagus Nerve\n01:43:09 Insatiable Sugar Appetite, Liking vs. Wanting, Gut-Brain Axis \n01:52:03 Tool: Sugar vs. Artificial Sweeteners, Curbing Appetite \n01:54:06 Cravings & Gut-Brain Axis  \n01:57:30 Nutrition, Gut-Brain Axis & Changes in Behavior \n02:01:53 Fast vs. Slow Signaling & Reinforcement, Highly Processed Foods  \n02:10:38 Favorite Foods: Enjoyment, Sensation & Context\n02:15:58 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments\u2014both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive \u201cthought-action loops\u201d and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nFull show notes & links to peer-reviewed articles: https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \n00:03:01 Momentous Supplements, AG1 (Athletic Greens), Thesis, Eight Sleep \n00:08:28 What is OCD and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder?\n00:11:18 OCD: Major Incidence & Severity \n00:15:10 Categories of OCD\n00:21:33 Anxiety: Linking Obsessions & Compulsions\n00:27:33 OCD & Familial Heredity \n00:29:10 Biological Mechanisms of OCD, Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loops\n00:39:36 Cortico-Striatal-Thalamic Loop & OCD \n00:46:39 Clinical OCD Diagnosis, Y-BOCS Index \n00:51:38 OCD & Fear, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) & Exposure Therapy \n01:01:56 Unique Characteristics of CBT/Exposure Therapy in OCD Treatment \n01:10:18 CBT/Exposure Therapy & Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) \n01:22:30 Considerations with SSRIs & Prescription Drug Treatments\n01:25:17 Serotonin & Cognitive Flexibility, Psilocybin Studies\n01:31:50 Neuroleptics & Neuromodulators \n01:36:09 OCD & Cannabis, THC & CBD \n01:39:29 Ketamine Treatment \n01:41:43 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) \n01:46:22 Cannabis CBD & Focus \n01:47:50 Thoughts Are Not Actions \n01:51:27 Hormones, Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone & GABA \n02:00:55 Holistic Treatments: Mindfulness Meditation & OCD\n02:03:28 Nutraceuticals & Supplements: Myo-Inositol, Glycine \n02:09:45 OCD vs. Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder \n02:20:53 Superstitions, Compulsions & Obsessions \n02:31:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

We also discuss learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skills- cognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought out teachers of movement alive today, the knowledge Ido shares in this conversation can benefit everyone\u2014children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians and trainers and the everyday person.\n\n#HubermanLab #IdoPortal #Movement \n\nWatch Ido Portal lead Andrew through his movement practice: https://youtu.be/JMzThWHk4CQ\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nIdo Portal Links\nWebsite: https://www.idoportal.com \nBlog: https://www.idoportal.com/blog \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/portal.ido \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/portaldo \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/portal.ido \n\nArticle Links\nThe Role of Variability in Motor Learning: https://bit.ly/3zOafQp\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Ido Portal, Movement & Movement Practice \n00:03:30 AG1 (Athletic Greens), ROKA, Helix Sleep \n00:07:49 What is Movement? \n00:10:56 Movement & the Body-Mind Connection\n00:14:47 Entry Points to Movement\n00:18:08 Early Education in Movement: Awareness, Play & Examination \n00:21:19 Stillness, Movement & the Environment, Playfulness  \n00:31:34 Unique Postures, Types of Movement, Contents vs. Containers \n00:40:50 Discomfort: Marker of Movement, Failures & Learning \n00:47:05 Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution  \n00:56:36 Animal & Human Movements, Gain & Change \n01:02:04 Core Movement, Emotion & Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution  \n01:12:39 Song, Dance & Complex Language, Movement as Language, Consilience \n01:21:39 Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild & Wise  \n01:26:36 Potential for Movement, \u201cHumming\u201d \n01:32:18 Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees of Freedom \n01:35:50 Variety, Diversity & Virtuosity \n01:38:06 Vision & Movement, Focus & Awareness, Panoramic Awareness  \n01:48:28 Hearing & Movement\n01:52:43 Walking Gaits\n01:56:55 Playful Variability & Evolution, Improvisation & Openness \n02:03:05 Reactivity & Personal Space, Touch & Proximity to Others, Play & Discomfort \n02:18:13 Visualization & Experience, Feedback \n02:20:14 Linear Movement & Movement Investigation, Examination \n02:31:45 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and \u201cmicro-stretching\u201d protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more. All people, physically active or not, should benefit from the information and tools described in this episode.\n\n#HubermanLab #Flexibility #Stretching\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nArticles\nForce enhancement after stretch of isolated myofibrils is increased by sarcomere length non-uniformities: https://go.nature.com/3tyUfxT\nMicrofluidic perfusion shows intersarcomere dynamics within single skeletal muscle myofibrils: https://bit.ly/3MLJWNV\nThe Effect of Time and Frequency of Static Stretching on Flexibility of the Hamstring Muscles: https://bit.ly/3aKIDRN\nThe Relation Between Stretching Typology and Stretching Duration: The Effects on Range of Motion: https://bit.ly/3aXtpcw\nA Comparison of Two Stretching Modalities on Lower-Limb Range of Motion Measurements in Recreational Dancers: https://bit.ly/3Hkpy5q\nStretching Reduces Tumor Growth in a Mouse Breast Cancer Model: https://go.nature.com/3xLQY0U\nInsular Cortex Mediates Increased Pain Tolerance in Yoga Practitioners: https://bit.ly/39pLIXd\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Flexibility & Stretching \n00:02:57 Thesis, InsideTracker, Eight Sleep \n00:07:22 Innate Flexibility \n00:09:23 Movement: Nervous System, Connective Tissue & Muscle; Range of Motion\n00:17:51 Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) & Load Sensing Mechanisms\n00:20:20 Decreased Flexibility & Aging\n00:22:38 Insula, Body Discomfort & Choice\n00:30:02 von Economo Neurons, Parasympathetic Activation & Relaxation \n00:42:00 Muscle Anatomy & Cellular \u2018Lengthening,\u2019 Range of Motion \n00:47:16 Tool: Protocol - Antagonistic Muscles, Pushing vs. Pulling Exercises \n00:51:57 Types of Stretching: Dynamic, Ballistic, Static & PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation)\n00:59:36 Tool: Increasing Range of Motion, Static Stretching Protocol, Duration\n01:05:56 Tool: Static Stretching Protocol & Frequency\n01:13:55 Tool: Effective Stretching Protocol\n01:17:12 Tool: Warming Up & Stretching\n01:19:17 Limb Range of Motion & General Health Benefits\n01:25:30 PNF Stretching, Golgi Tendon Organs & Autogenic Inhibition\n01:31:23 Tool: Anderson Protocol & End Range of Motion, Feeling the Stretch \n01:32:50 Tool: Effectiveness, Low Intensity Stretching, \u201cMicro-Stretching\u201d  \n01:41:33 Tool: Should you Stretch Before or After Other Exercises?\n01:45:41 Stretching, Relaxation, Inflammation & Disease \n01:51:37 Insula & Discomfort, Pain Tolerance & Yoga \n02:00:36 Tools: Summary of Stretching Protocols \n02:03:00 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.\n\nWe recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.\n\n#HubermanLab #Grief\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\n\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3thCToZ\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3PYzuFs\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3amI809\n\nArticles\nCraving love?

Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.  \n\n#HubermanLab #ColdExposure #IceBaths\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com - use code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nTuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA\nWednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSubscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast:\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3DbFdlv\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/34Xod5H\nGoogle Podcasts: https://bit.ly/3wo01EJ\nOther platforms: https://hubermanlab.com/follow\n\nArticle Links\nBrief aerobic exercise immediately enhances visual attentional control and perceptual speed.

I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual\u2019s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates \u2018hidden\u2019 sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create.

Dr. Sonnenburg\u2019s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.\n\n#HubermanLab #Microbiome #GutHealth \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nROKA: https://roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nSee Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   \nTuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA\nWednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  \nhttps://hubermanlab.com/tour - code: \u2018huberman\u2019 \nPre-sale tickets go on sale on Tuesday, March 8th at 10 AM PT \n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Justin Sonnenburg Links:\nCenter for Microbiome Studies: https://stanford.io/3vGkdS0 \nDr. Sonnenburg\u2019s Lab: https://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu \nDr. Sonnenburg\u2019s Published Work: https://stanford.io/3HN6eMF\n\nArticle Links:\n\"Gut-microbiota-targeted diets modulate human immune status\": https://bit.ly/3sLv2QI\n\nBook Links:\n\"The Good Gut: Taking Control of Your Weight, Your Mood, and Your Long-Term Health\": https://amzn.to/35RQP0c\n\"The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything and Living the Good Life\": https://amzn.to/3hqxkP0\n\nOther Links:\nNIH Human Microbiome Project: https://hmpdacc.org \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Gut Microbiome \n00:02:55 The Brain Body Contract   \n00:04:16 AG1 (Athletic Greens), ROKA, Helix Sleep \n00:08:30 What is the Gut Microbiome?\n00:12:49 Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability \n00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets\n00:21:56 The Human Microbiome Project at Stanford\n00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations\n00:28:58 Resilience of the Microbiome\n00:35:10 Regional Differences Along Your GI Tract \n00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health\n00:51:19 Dietary Differences \n01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods \n01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners \n01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful?

I cover the structure and function of the gut-brain axis and the role of the gut microbiome in the brain and overall health. I describe how the gut controls hunger or satiety by affecting neurons in our brain. I also contrast the many pathways by which the gut influences the brain: direct vs. indirect pathways, chemical vs. mechanical, and fast vs. slow signaling. Additionally, I discuss what defines a healthy microbiome and how your lifestyle impacts the gut microbiome, including the effects of stress, fasting, antibiotics, pets, environment, prebiotics and probiotics. I address how different foods shape the gut microbiome, in particular, the emerging data that fermented foods can increase the diversity of healthy gut microbiota.  Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed and textbook findings that reveal the critical role of the gut microbiome in supporting mental and physical health and I outline simple tools that anyone can use in order to enhance their gut microbiome health.\n\n#HubermanLab #GutHealth #Microbiome\n\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman \nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman \nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nArticle Links\n\"The Emerging Biology of Gut-Brain Sensory Transduction\": https://bit.ly/3HruBiE\n\"Mechanisms Underlying Microbial-Mediated Changes in Social Behavior in Mouse Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder\": https://bit.ly/3hmq5Y2\n\"Association of Loneliness and Wisdom With Gut Microbial Diversity and Composition: An Exploratory Study\": https://bit.ly/3spfYs2\n\"Emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype\": https://go.nature.com/3tcLKYp\n\"Brain fogginess, gas and bloating: a link between SIBO, probiotics and metabolic acidosis\": https://bit.ly/33YlsR9\n\"Gut-microbiota-targeted diets modulate human immune status\": https://bit.ly/3vlkQQD\n\"The preference for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sensor cell\": https://go.nature.com/33X9zuA\n\nBook Links\n\"The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything and Living the Good Life\": https://amzn.to/3hqxkP0\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Gut Microbiome  \n00:03:02 AG1 (Athletic Greens), LMNT, InsideTracker \n00:06:55 Your Gut-Brain Axis \n00:09:44 Gut-Brain Anatomy\n00:15:32 Microbiota vs. Gut Microbiome \n00:20:01 Roles of Gut Microbiome \n00:23:03 Neuropod Cells: (Subconscious) Tasting with Your Stomach \n00:34:13 Ghrelin: Slow Modulation of Your Brain in Hunger\n00:38:02 Glucagon Like Peptide 1; GLP-1 \n00:42:22 Tools: \u2018Free Will\u2019 & Food Cravings \n00:44:46 Mechanical Cues from Gut to Brain\n00:49:05 Dopamines, Vomiting \n00:52:06 Indirect Signals from Gut Microbiota\n00:59:30 Gut Microbiome \u201cCritical Periods\u201d  \n01:03:08 How Gut Health Controls Overall Health \n01:12:25 What is a Healthy Gut Microbiome?\n01:15:00 Tools: Enhance Your Gut Microbiome\n01:23:49 Foods to Enhance Microbiota Diversity; Fermented Foods \n01:37:07 High-Fiber Diets & Inflammation\n01:40:58 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners \n01:44:27 Structure & Function of Gut-Brain Axis \n01:49:47 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise, and even to the foods we eat. We discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes whether it is satisfying to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also tells how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure, and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance.

I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit.

We discuss how and why humans breathe the way we do, the function of the diaphragm and how it serves to increase oxygenation of the brain and body. We discuss how breathing influences mental state, fear, memory, reaction time, and more. And we discuss specific breathing protocols such as box-breathing, cyclic hyperventilation (similar to Wim Hof breathing), nasal versus mouth breathing, unilateral breathing, and how these each effect the brain and body. We discuss physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing, and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work.

The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation.\n\nI also discuss \"task bracketing\" as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). I also review the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits. \n\nThe science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more\u2014indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.\n\n#HubermanLab #Habits #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - http://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - http://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep - http://www.helixsleep.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nExcellent review on science of habits - https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033417\nMeta-analysis on habits - https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1539449219876877\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Habits; New Programs\n00:02:30 Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Helix Sleep\n00:06:52 Habits versus Reflexes, Learning, Neuroplasticity\n00:08:51 Goal-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits\n00:11:40 How Long It (Really) Takes to Form a Habit; Limbic-Friction\n00:16:07 Linchpin Habits \n00:18:55 Mapping Your Habits; Habit Strength, Context-Dependence\n00:22:55 Automaticity\n00:24:03 Tool 1: Applying Procedural Memory Visualizations\n00:27:48 Hebbian Learning, NMDA receptors\n00:31:00 Tool 2: Task Bracketing; Dorsolateral Striatum\n00:37:08 States of Mind, Not Scheduling Time Predicts Habit Strength\n00:38:16 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 1\n00:46:29 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 2\n00:55:24 Tool 3: Phase-Based Habit Plan: Phase 3\n01:01:34 Habit Flexibility\n01:04:57 Should We Reward Ourselves?

Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022. \n\nIn this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology. This episode includes lots of basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.\n\n#HubermanLab #DavidSinclair #Longevity\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://www.magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nDr. David Sinclair Links:\nLifespan Podcast: https://lifespanpodcast.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/davidasinclair \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/davidsinclairphd/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/davidsinclairpodcast \nLifespan (book): https://amzn.to/47MLimC\nAging Test Waitlist: https://www.tallyhealth.com\nHarvard Lab Website: https://sinclair.hms.harvard.edu\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School\n00:03:30 ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon\n00:07:45 \u201cAging as a Disease\u201d vs. Longevity & Anti-Aging\n00:10:23 What Causes Aging?

He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves. \n\nHere Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining: how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see, and remember. Also, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind, and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats. \n\nWe discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system\u2014one that, in just less than two hours, will teach you an entire course's worth about the brain and how yours works.\n\n#HubermanLab #Brain #Neuroscience\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nInsideTracker Interview - https://blog.insidetracker.com/longevity-by-design-andrew-huberman\nDr. Berson's Webpage - \nhttps://vivo.brown.edu/display/dberson\nEyewire - (Contribute to Neuroscience Research from Home/Computer -\nhttps://eyewire.org/explore \nBest Neuroscience Textbook (NOTE this is a TEXTBOOK) - https://amzn.to/3lZWrL4\nBook - We Know It When We See It by Richard Masland - https://amzn.to/31S60Vp\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. David Berson \n00:02:55 Sponsors: Athletic Greens, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon \n00:08:02 How We See \n00:10:02 Color Vision \n00:13:47 \u201cStrange\u201d Vision\n00:16:56 How You Orient In Time\n00:25:45 Body Rhythms, Pineal function, Light & Melatonin, Blueblockers\n00:34:45 Spending Times Outdoors Improves Eyesight \n00:36:20 Sensation, Mood, & Self-Image\n00:41:03 Sense of Balance\n00:50:43 Why Pigeons Bob Their Heads, Motion Sickness \n01:00:03 Popping Ears\n01:02:35 Midbrain & Blindsight \n01:10:44 Why Tilted Motion Feels Good \n01:13:24 Reflexes vs. Deliberate Actions\n01:16:35 Basal Ganglia & the \u201c2 Marshmallow Test\u201d\n01:24:40 Suppressing Reflexes: Cortex \n01:33:33 Neuroplasticity \n01:36:27 What is a Connectome?\n01:45:20 How to Learn (More About the Brain)\n01:49:04 Book Suggestion, my Berson Appreciation\n01:50:20 Zero-Cost ways to Support the HLP, Guest Suggestions, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how \"top-down\" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine and other drug-assisted therapies and more. I also review new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And I review the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body.

We also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people\u2019s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And we discuss what Dr. Buss calls \u201cthe dark triad\u201d\u2014 features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.\n\nThis episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Buss' New Book \"When Men Behave Badly\" - https://amzn.to/3FThTsG\nDr. Buss' Website at University of Texas, Austin - https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/david-buss/\nDr. Buss' Twitter - https://twitter.com/ProfDavidBuss\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. David Buss\n00:04:10 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Headspace\n00:08:33 Choosing a Mate\n00:13:40 Long Term Mates: Universal Desires\n00:18:31 What Women & Men Seek in Long-Term Mates\n00:25:10 Age Differences & Mating History \n00:32:20 Deception in Courtship\n00:37:30 Emotional Stability\n00:38:40 Lying About Long-Term Interest\n00:41:56 Short-Term Mating Criteria, Sliding Standards & Context Effects\n00:46:25 Sexual Infidelity: Variety Seeking & (Un)happiness & Mate Switching\n00:54:25 Genetic Cuckolds, How Ovulation Impacts Mate Preference\n00:57:00 Long-Term vs. Short-Term Cheating, Concealment\n00:59:15 Emotional & Financial Infidelity\n01:04:35 Contraception \n01:06:22 Status & Mating Success\n01:10:10 Jealousy, Mate Value Discrepancies, Vigilance, Violence\n01:24:13 Specificity of Intimate Partner Violence  \n01:25:12 Mate Retention Tactics: Denigration, Guilt, Etc.\n01:27:33 Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy\n01:33:25 Stalking\n01:39:15 Influence of Children on Mate Value Assessments \n01:43:24 Attachment Styles, Mate Choice & Infidelity\n01:46:40 Non-Monogamy, Unconventional Relationships  \n01:54:00 Mate Value Self Evaluation, Anxiety About the Truth\n02:02:12 Self Deception\n02:05:35 The Future of Evolutionary Psychology & Neuroscience  \n02:06:56 Books: When Men Behave Badly; The Evolution of Desire, Textbooks\n02:10:42 Concluding Statements, Zero-Cost Support: Subscribe, Sponsors, Patreon, Thorne\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://www.magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttps://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nNeural Correlates of Gratitude (Damasio) - https://bit.ly/3oS8TNr\nReducing Inflammatory Cytokines & Fear With Gratitude - https://bit.ly/3oPsSwv\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction: Gratitude Science & Surprises\n00:01:50 Controlling Heart Rate with Story\n00:04:33 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon\n00:09:11 Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice\n00:12:20 Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, & Neural Circuits \n00:17:50 Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice\n00:21:22 Neurochemistry & Neural Circuits of Gratitude\n00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context\n00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables\n00:34:55 Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks & Story\n00:42:30 Theory of Mind Is Key\n00:45:50 Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration\n00:52:28 Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits \n00:56:15 You Can\u2019t Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance In Giving\n00:59:55 How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation\n01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day \n01:05:44 Empathy & Anterior Cingulate Cortex\n01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation & Fear with Gratitude\n01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin \n01:16:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces\n01:18:50 The Best Gratitude Practices: & How To, My Protocol\n01:24:25 Subscribe & Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements (Thorne)\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. I include ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code \"huberman\"\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Time Perception, Note on Fasting & Supplements\n00:05:12 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker\n00:09:25 Entrainment, Circannual Entrainment, Melatonin\n00:13:20 Seasonal Oscillations in Testosterone & Estrogen, Tool 1\n00:16:06 Circadian Timing, Tools 1, 2, 3 (for Circadian Entrainment)\n00:21:13 Tool 4: Timing Physical Activity; Tool 5: Timing Eating Window\n00:23:00 When Circadian Entrainment is Disrupted, Time Perception Suffers\n00:25:00 Tool 6: Ultradian (90min) Cycles & Focus\n00:31:42 Our Sense of the Passage of Time: Present, Prospective, Retrospective\n00:34:40 Dopamine (& Nor/epinephrine) Lead to Time Overestimation; Frame Rate \n00:37:18 Serotonin & Time Underestimation; Decreased Frame Rate\n00:39:10 Dopamine vs. Serotonin Across the Day; Tool 7: When to Do Rigid vs. Creative Work\n00:42:38 Example of Tool 7\n00:43:38 How Sleep Deprivation Degrades Performance\n00:44:38 Trauma, \u201cOver-clocking\u201d & Memories; Adjusting Rates of Experience\n00:50:04 Why Trauma Involves Dopamine & Epinephrine, Arousal\n00:51:03 Dopamine, Spontaneous Blinking & Time Perception; Tool 8\n00:53:38 Deliberate Cold Exposure, Dopamine, Tool 9: Adjusting Frame Rate in Discomfort\n00:56:30 Fun \u201cFeels Fast\u201d BUT Is Remembered as Slow; Boring Stuff \u201cFeels Slow,\u201d Recall As Fast\n01:00:54 Retrospective Time, Context Variation & Enhanced Bonding with Places & People\n01:03:00 Dopamine Release Resets the Start of Each Time Bin on Our Experience\n01:07:40 Habits & Time Perception; Tool 10 (Setting Functional Units of Each Day)\n01:11:58 Synthesis & Book Suggestion (Your Brain Is a Time Machine by D.

We discuss specific resistance (weight) training regimens for increasing testosterone in men and women and how to vary mechanical loads and rest between sets and workouts to optimize hormone output and training results. We also discuss how stress-induced \"catecholamines\" can increase testosterone or decrease it, depending on duration and mindset. And we discuss specific cold- and heat- therapies for increasing resilience, reducing inflammation, heat shock proteins and more. We discuss nutrition for training and how to match nutrition to training goals and metabolic flexibility. We discuss mental focus and how long to train for skill development. Finally, we discuss how mixed martial arts and the UFC Performance Institute are a template for exploring human performance more generally. This episode is intended for anyone interested in athletic and mental performance: athletes, students, and recreational exercisers and includes both science and many practical tools people can apply in their own training. \n\n#UFC #UFC268 #HubermanLab\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://roka.com -- code \"huberman\"\nHelix Sleep - https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://headspace.com/specialoffer \n\nDr. Duncan French:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/dr_duncan_french\nLinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-french-phd-a41bb9122\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. Duncan French \n00:02:27 Roka, Helix Sleep, Headspace\n00:05:44 Duncan\u2019s Background in Exercise Science\n00:11:45 How Certain Exercises Increase Testosterone\n00:16:22 What Kind of Training Increases Testosterone & Growth Hormone?\n00:20:19 Intensity: Mechanical Load; Volume: Metabolic Load; Inter-set Rest Periods\n00:25:25 Training Frequency & Combining Workout Goals  \n00:29:35 How Stress Can Increase or Decrease Testosterone \n00:36:55 Using Cold Exposure for Mindset, Anti-Inflammation, Muscle-Growth\n00:46:55 Skill Development\n00:50:05 Why Hard Exercise Creates Brain Fog: Role of Nutrition \n00:53:55 Low-Carbohydrate Versus All-Macronutrient Diets on Performance\n00:56:15 Ketones & Brain Energy, Offsetting Brain Injury; Spiking Glucose During Ketosis\n00:59:13 Metabolic Efficiency, Matching Nutrition to Training, \u201cNeeds Based Eating\u201d\n01:05:00 Duncan\u2019s Work with Olympic Athletes, NCAA, UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)\n01:08:00 Why UFC & MMA (Mixed-Martial Arts) Are So Valuable for Advancing Performance\n01:12:40 Voluntarily Switching Between Different States of Arousal\n01:14:30 Heat, Getting Better at Sweating, Heat Shock Proteins, Sauna\n01:20:12 Using Rotating 12-Week Training Programs; Logging Objective & Subjective Data\n01:24:07 Surprising & Unknown Aspects of The UFC and UFC Performance Institute\n01:27:45 Conclusions, Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.\n\nI discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic \"washout\" of brain debris during sleep. I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation). \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code: \"huberman\"\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nHow and Why The Immune System Makes Us Sleep - https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2576\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 The Mind & Immune System, New Findings: Acupuncture & Fascia\n00:03:00 Sponsors: ROKA, Athletic Greens, InsideTracker\n00:07:41 Foundational Tools & Practices for a Healthy Immune System\n00:11:20 Immune System Basics: Skin/Mucous, Innate & Adaptive Immune System\n00:17:08 Killer Cells, Complement Proteins (\u201cEat Me!\u201d Signals), Cytokines (\u201cHelp Me!\u201d Signals)\n00:21:06 The Adaptive Immune System: Antibodies\n00:28:00 Tool 1: Nasal Microbiome and \u201cScrubbing\u201d Bacteria & Viruses; Nasal Breathing\n00:30:33 Tools 2 & 3: (Not) Touching Your Eyes; Gut Microbiome & Fermented Foods\n00:34:20 Some Interleukins Are Anti-Inflammatory\n00:34:56 Sickness Behavior\n00:39:08 Some People Seek Care When Sick, Others Want to be Alone\n00:42:00 Sickness Behavior & Depression: Cytokines\n00:43:40 Reduced Appetites When Sick: Protein, Iron, Libido\n00:46:45 Vagus-Nerve Stimulation: Fever, Photophobia, Sleepiness\n00:53:03 Humoral (Blood-Borne) Factors, & Choroid Change Your Brain State\n00:55:04 Tools 4, 5: Reducing Sickness: Glymphatic Clearance, Pre-Sleep Serotonin, 5HTP\n01:07:03 Tool 6: Hot Showers, Saunas, Baths & Cortisol, Heath-Cold Contrast\n01:10:53 Feed a Fever & Starve a Cold (?), Adrenaline\n01:12:36 Tool 7: Activating Your Immune System w/Cyclic-Hyperventilation, Alkalinity\n01:29:10 Brain Chemicals & Cyclic-Hyperventilation; Catecholamines, Dopamine\n01:32:10 Mindsets & Immune Function; Yes, You Can Worry Yourself Sick\n01:37:00 Tool 8: Healthy Mindsets, Hope, Dopamine; Tool 9: Tyrosine; Tool 10: Cold Exposure\n01:42:05 Once You\u2019re Already Sick: Accelerating Recovery; Tool 11: Spirulina, Rhinitis\n01:46:09 Histamines, Mast Cells\n01:49:22 Tool 12: Acupuncture: Mechanism for How It Reduces Inflammation; Fascia, Rolfing \n01:53:40 Mechanistic Science & Ancient Practices\n01:58:00 Synthesis, Ways to Support Us (Zero-Cost), Sponsors, Supplements, Social Media\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. And he offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jetlag, shift work, and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing. This episode is filled with cutting-edge data on the biological mechanisms of human physiology and practical tools for people of all ages. \n\n#HubermanLab #Science #CircadianRhythm\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code: \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://www.magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nSupport Research in Huberman Lab at Stanford:\nhttps://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nSamer Hattar:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/samerhattar\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/samerhattar\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samer_Hattar\n\nLinks:\nGraphical Explanation of Temperature Minimum for Overcoming Jetlag: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKWiRVJHVwC/\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Samer Hattar, Ph.D.\n00:02:17 Sponsors: ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon\n00:06:15 Light, Circadian (24 hour) & Circannual (365 day) \u201cPhotoentrainment\u201d \n00:14:30 Neurons in Our Eyes That Set Our Body Clocks: Similar to Frog Skin\n00:18:55 What Blind People See \n00:20:15 When, How & How Long to View Light for Optimal Sleep & Wakefulness\n00:30:20 Sunlight Simulators, Afternoon Light Viewing, Naps\n00:33:48 Are You Jetlagged at Home?

I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.\n\nThen I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental,  in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than 10 actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function, and it explains modern neuroscience underlying of our sense of taste, our food seeking preferences and brain metabolism.\n\n#HubermanLab #Diet #Brain\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com -- code: \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nRETHINK EDUCATION: The Biology of Learning Featuring Dr. Andrew Huberman:\nhttps://youtu.be/Oo7hQapFe3M\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nReview on Anthocyanins & Cognition - https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/23/4255\nReview on Creatine & Brain Health Studies - https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/586\nReview on \"Rethinking Food Reward\" - www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011643\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Food & Brain Function Introduction\n00:02:08 Summary: Critical Aspects of Time Restricted Feeding/Fasting\n00:04:19 Sponsors: Roka, Athletic Greens, Headspace\n00:08:24 Neuroplasticity Super Protocol (Zero-Cost Tools) Online\n00:09:22 Eating to Enhance Brain Function & Foundational Aspects of Brain Health \n00:13:00 Eating Fats for Brain Health, EFAs Phospholipids (Tool 1: 1-3g EPA Omega-3/day) \n00:20:35 Phosphatidylserine (Tool 2: 300mg/day)\n00:22:15 Choline, Egg Yolks (Tool 3: 1-2g/day Threshold)\n00:28:26 Hydration & Electrolytes (Tool 4)\n00:29:50 Liquid Fish Oil/Capsules (2-3g EPA per day; 300mg Alpha GPC 2-4X/week)\n00:32:22 Creatine for Cognition (Tool 5: 5g/day) \n00:36:28 Anthocyanins, Dark Skin Berries (Tool 6-10mg/day (Extract), 1-2 cups Berries) \n00:41:19 L-Glutamine (Tool: 1-10g/day) & Offsetting Apnea & Inflammation\n00:49:23 Neural Basis of Food Preference, Yum, Yuck, Meh; Taste, Guts, & Beliefs\n00:55:25 Taste is 100% In your Head\n00:59:50 Gut Neurons Controlling Food Preference: Neuropod Cells; (Tool 7: Fermented Foods) \n01:06:14 Capsule Probiotics, Brain Fog \n01:07:16 Learning to Like Specific Tastes: Sweetness & Brain Metabolism\n01:12:11 Hard-Wiring & Soft-Wiring\n01:13:25 Artificial & Non-Caloric Sweeteners: Safe or Harmful Depends on (Glucose) Context\n01:18:15 Non-Caloric Sweetener & Insulin; (Tool 8: Don\u2019t Have w/Glucose Elevating Foods)\n01:22:17 Beliefs & Thoughts; The Insula; (Tool 9: Pairing-Based Reshaping Food Preferences) \n01:30:42 Liking Neuro-Healthy Foods & Bettering Brain Metabolism (Tool 10); Food Wars\n01:36:05 Food Reward & Diabetes, Obesity; Important Review Article (See Caption)\n01:38:28 Synthesis, Zero-Cost Support, Future Topic Suggestions, Sponsors, Supplements\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I review the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. I explain how \"fasted\" is contextual, and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise, or with glucose disposal agents. I also discuss the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. I also discuss what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol and on fertility. I also review how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting, and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal.

We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how most everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster, as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs!

I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine\u2014both their benefits and risks\u2014and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine. \n\n#HubermanLab #Dopamine #Motivation\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nLogitech Event - Rethink Education: The Biology of Learning\nhttps://info.logitech.com/ReThink-Education.html\n\nSupport Research in Huberman Lab at Stanford:\nhttps://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nReview on Dopamine: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00455-7\nCold Exposure & Dopamine: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004210050065\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction & Tool 1 to Induce Lasting Dopamine\n00:04:48 Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Headspace\n00:09:10 Upcoming (Zero-Cost) Neuroplasticity Seminar for Educators\n00:09:58 What Dopamine (Really) Does\n00:15:30 Two Main Neural Circuits for Dopamine \n00:18:14 How Dopamine Is Released: Locally and Broadly\n00:22:03 Fast and Slow Effects of Dopamine\n00:25:03 Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate\n00:28:00 Your Dopamine History Really Matters \n00:30:30 Parkinson\u2019s & Drugs That Kill Dopamine Neurons.

We discuss the biology and medical clinical-trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD.\u00a0Dr. Johnson teaches us what the clinical trials in his lab are revealing about the potential these compounds hold for the treatment of depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD, and other disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory, start to finish, including the conditions for optimal clinical outcomes. And he explains some of the potential hazards and common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine. Dr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks of certain people and age groups using psychedelics and the ever evolving legal and pharmaceutical industry landscape surrounding psychedelics. Dr. Johnson also explains how the scientific study of psychedelics is likely to set the trajectory of psychiatric medicine in the years to come. Dr. Johnson is among a small handful of researchers who have pioneered the clinical study of these powerful compounds. He has unprecedented insight into how they can be woven into other psychiatric treatments, changing ones sense of self and of reality. \n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nAthletic Greens - http://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - http://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nDr. Matthew Johnson Social Media: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Drug_Researcher\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drug_researcher\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Johnson\u2019s Website at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine - https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/johnson\nChris Letheby\u2019s forthcoming book - https://amzn.to/3nMTaAs \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introducing Dr. Matthew Johnson\n00:02:10 Supporting Sponsors\n00:06:40 \u2018Psychedelics\u2019 Defined\n00:14:09 Hallucinations, Synesthesia, Altered Space-Time Perception\n00:19:56 Serotonin & Dopamine \n00:23:50 Ketamine & Glutamate \n00:28:00 An Example Psychedelic Experiment\n00:37:30 \u2018Letting Go\u2019 with Psychedelics\n00:44:10 Our Mind\u2019s Eye\n00:48:00 Redefining Your Sense of Self \n00:58:56 Exporting Psychedelic Learnings to Daily Life\n01:04:36 Flashbacks\n01:12:10 Ayahuasca, & ASMR, Kundalini Breathing\n01:15:54 MDMA, DMT\n01:26:00 Dangers of Psychedelics, Bad Trips, Long-Lasting Psychosis\n01:38:15 Micro-Dosing\n01:56:45 Risks for Kids, Adolescents & Teenagers; Future Clinical Trials\n02:03:40 Legal Status: Decriminalization vs. Legalization vs. Regulation\n02:18:35 Psychedelics for Treating Concussion & Traumatic Brain Injury \n02:27:45 Shifting Trends in Psychedelic Research, Academic Culture\n02:44:23 Participating in a Clinical Trial, Online Survey Studies, Breathwork \n02:50:38 Conclusions, Subscribing & Supporting the HLP, Supplements\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.\n\nThen I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the \"perfectionist\" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. I also discuss new more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia, and both their promise and risks.\n\nI review the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD.

We discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress, and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context. We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone \u2014 how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And we discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society. \n\n#HubermanLab #Testosterone #Stress\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://roka.com - use code \"huberman\"\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin Newsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nDr. Sapolsky's most recent book, \"Behave: The Biology of Humans At Our Best & Worst\": https://amzn.to/3yrZ6k7\nSupport Research in the Huberman Lab at Stanford on Stress, Sleep & Human Performance: https://hubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Introduction: Dr. Robert Sapolsky \n00:02:26 Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker \n00:06:30 Stress: Short & Long-Term, Good & Bad \n00:09:11 Valence & Amygdala \n00:11:00 Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths \n00:15:15 Behaviors that Affect Testosterone  \n00:17:20 Mindsets & Contexts that Affect Testosterone\n00:20:28 How Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels  \n00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, & Female-Female \n00:24:05 Testosterone: The Challenge Hypothesis \n00:29:20 How Dopamine Impacts Testosterone & Motivation \n00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain & Longevity BUT TIMING IS KEY \n00:39:40 Are Testosterone & Sperm Counts in Males Really Dropping? \n00:42:15 Stress Mitigation & Our Sense of Control \n00:51:35 How Best to Buffer Stress \n00:57:04 Power of Perception, Choice & Individual Differences \n01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex & Hierarchy \n01:11:20 How Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking  \n01:13:17 Do We Have Free Will? \n01:20:50 How to Apply Knowledge & Learning  \n01:23:44 Robert\u2019s New Book: \u201cDetermined: The Science of Life Without Free Will\u201d \n01:28:27 Reflections, Support of Podcast, & Supporting Stress Research \n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.\n\n#Depression #HubermanLab #Dopamine\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nAthletic Greens - https://www.athleticgreens.com/huberman\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin Newsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nReview of EPAs for the Treatment of Depression - https://bit.ly/2Wl15ti\nReview of Creatine for the Treatment of Depression - https://www.mdpi.com/520864\nRecent Study on the Clinical Use of Psilocybin for Treatment of Depression - https://bit.ly/3sFSGMM\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Mood Disorders & Maintaining Mental Health (Protocol 1)\n00:07:10 Sponsors\n00:11:15 Major Depression\n00:18:40 \u201cAnti-Self\u201d Confabulation\n00:21:42 Autonomic (Vegetative) Symptoms of Depression\n00:26:58 Norepinephrine, Dopamine & Serotonin\n00:31:50 SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.): Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\n00:37:00 Epinephrine/Motor Functions, Dopamine/Motivation & Craving, Serotonin/Emotions\n00:39:33 Physical & Emotional Pain are Linked: Substance P\n00:41:50 Hormones & Depression: Thyroid & Cortisol \n00:46:50 Genetic Susceptibility to Depression: Impact of Stress \n00:50:50 Understanding Biological Mechanism Is Key: Recipes versus Skills\n00:52:50 Tools for Dealing with Depression: Logic & Implementation (Protocol 2)\n00:56:25 Brain Inflammation & Mental State: Cytokines, Prostaglandins, etc.\n00:59:20 Protocol 3: Essential Fatty Acids (Omega-3, EPAs: Eicosapentaenoic Acid)*\n01:02:50 How EPAs Help Offset Depression: Serotonin Synthesis, Kynurenine, Quinolinic Acid\n01:05:25 Protocol 4: How Exercise Offsets Depression \n01:11:44 Protocol 5: Creatine Monohydrate, Forebrain Function & NMDA receptors*\n01:20:30 Protocol 6*: Ketamine, PCP (*Prescription-Only), & NMDA-Receptor Function\n01:33:08 Protocol 7*: Psychedelics (*In Clinical Trials) for Major Depression: Psilocybin*\n01:47:00 Protocol 8: Ketogenic Diet, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)\n01:54:50 Summary of Protocols Covered\n02:00:10 Support & Additional Resources\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist expert in treating addictions of all kinds: drugs, alcohol, food, sex, video games, gambling, food, medication, etc. Dr. Lembke is also an expert in the opioid crisis, and the author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence (https://amzn.to/3AHHGBp).\n\nWe discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our \"dopamine balance\" plays in creating addiction. We also discuss the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying and she explains why telling the truth\u2014even about the most basic things in daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain.\n\nThis episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean. Last but not least, it helps explain why all humans do what we do, and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of pleasure seeking in life.\n\n#HubermanLab #Addiction #Dopamine\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nDr. Anna Lembke Links:\nWebsite: https://www.annalembke.com\nStanford Profile: https://profiles.stanford.edu/anna-lembke\nDopamine Nation (new book): https://amzn.to/3Ra4qEa\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. Anna Lembke, Addiction Expert\n00:02:25 Disclaimer & Sponsors: Roka, InsideTracker, Headspace\n00:07:00 Dopamine, Happiness & Impulsivity \n00:15:56 What Is Pleasure? \n00:18:20 Addiction, Boredom & Passion for Life\n00:24:00 Pain-Pleasure Balance Controls Addiction\n00:29:10 Dopamine Deficits, Anhedonia\n00:30:47 Are All Addictions the Same?\n00:35:38 Boredom & Anxiety Lead to Creativity \n00:40:35 Finding Your Passion Starts with Boredom & Action Steps \n00:50:05 How to Break an Addiction\n00:55:25 Relapse, Craving & Triggers\n01:07:40 Can People Get Addicted To \u201cSobriety\u201d? \n01:11:45 Are We All Wired for Addiction? \n01:15:57 Bizarre Addiction\n01:18:14 Recovered Addicts Are Heroes\n01:20:10 Lying, Truth Telling, Guilt & Shame\n01:30:40 Clinical Applications of: Ibogaine, Ayahuasca, Psilocybin & MDMA \n01:40:20 Social Media Addiction \n01:51:25 Narcissism \n01:53:30 Goal Seeking, Success & Surprise\n01:58:10 Reciprocity\n02:01:15 Closing Comments, Resources\n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I discuss the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. I also discuss whole body pain, pain \"syndromes\" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. I discuss neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, with arousal, pleasure and pain.

The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. I describe how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways. I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.\n\n#HubermanLab #Brain #Health\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com - code: huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nHeadspace - https://www.headspace.com/specialoffer\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\n\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nJoin the Neural Network - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nLinks:\nSonnenburg, Cell Press Study - https://bit.ly/SonnenburgCellPress\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Your Sense of Self: Interoception\n00:01:25 Protocol 1: Fermented Foods, Not Fiber, to Reduce Inflammation \n00:03:30 Attributions\n00:08:22 Main Drivers of Feelings & Performance\n00:11:45 Brain-Body: A Mechanical & Chemical Dialogue \n00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue  \n00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate With Breathing\n00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors\n00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, From Air to Blood\n00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert While Calm\n00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex\n00:42:47 Gut Volume & The Desire to Open Your Mouth \n00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting \n00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids & Sugar\n00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings with Specific Amino Acid Nutrients \n00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)\n01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome \n01:04:13 Inflammation & Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented \n01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation & Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented Foods\n01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune function & Glutamine\n01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin\n01:18:30 Probiotics & Brain Fog\n01:21:45 Nausea: Happens in Your Brain; Area Postrema\n01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.\n01:30:40 Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT\n01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling the Blood Properly\n01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress\n01:41:50 Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions\n01:45:00 Sensing Other People\u2019s Emotions via the Body\n01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat \n01:50:40 Conclusions & Resources\n\nPlease note that The Huberman Lab Podcast is distinct from Dr. Huberman's teaching and research roles at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Most people don't realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. I explain how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day-- a practice is rarely discussed but very well supported by the science literature. I also discuss an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. I discuss if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation-- it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matters. And I discuss the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss.

I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives.

I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering the release of the hormone CCK, and more. \n\nNote: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone.

I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex, or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: \"what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?\"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause. As always a mix of basic science, biological mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed.\n\n**Note: Future episodes will focus on the science of prescription hormone replacement therapies, the science of hormone-based birth control and the role of testosterone, estrogen and other compounds in fertility, athletic performance and recovery.\n\n#HubermanLab #Testosterone #Estrogen \n\nThank you to our sponsors\nFour Sigmatic - https://foursigmatic.com/huberman \nBlinkist - https://blinkist.com/huberman \nTheragun - https://theragun.com/huberman \n\nBloodwork sponsor\nInsideTracker - https://insidetracker.com/huberman \n\nSupplements from Thorne\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nReferences:\nExamine: https://examine.com\n\u201cBehavioral Endocrinology\u201d by Nelson and Kriegsfeld 5th Ed.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:05:50 Hormone Optimization  \n00:07:00 Salutogenesis: A Powerful Way to Conceptualize Health \n00:10:03 Estrogen and Testosterone: Sources, Levels & Ratios  \n00:15:46 The Power of Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence & Dopamine\n00:20:58 Testosterone & Libido Pre-Ovulation \n00:21:48 Estrogen & Sexual Receptivity; Libido In Males \n00:23:10 How Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence \n00:26:46 Testosterone & Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs Pair Bonding \n00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects on Levels/Ratios  \n00:28:45 Behaviors That Decrease Testosterone (& Cortisol): Parenting & Prolactin \n00:31:24 How Illness Impacts Testosterone & Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6 \n00:33:20 How Exactly Do Behaviors Change Hormones?  \n00:34:18 Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, & Mate Recognition \n00:43:33 Apnea: A Powerful Bi-Directional Influence On Estrogen & Testosterone \n00:47:44 Mouth vs. Nose Breathing & Hormone Levels: Effects Via Sleep and Direct Effects \n00:51:11 How Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone and Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios \n00:53:49 02:CO2 Ratios, Nasal Breathing During Exercise \n00:56:30 Light Viewing Patterns & Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH \n00:57:44 Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency \n01:04:39 Specificity of Hormone Effects \n01:06:03 Temperature: Cold & Hot Gonads \n01:14:10 How To Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing \n01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First or Last?)

I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.\n\n#HubermanLab #Motivation #Neuroscience\n\nFor an updated list of our current sponsors, please visit our website as previous sponsors mentioned in this podcast episode may no longer be affiliated with us: https://hubermanlab.com/sponsors\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\nLink to study:\nEffects of expectation on specificity of stimulant effects: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33734725/\n\nTimestamps\n00:00:00 Introduction \n00:04:22 Announcement: Spanish Subtitles \n00:05:06 Emotions, Addiction & Mindset \n00:06:22 Motivation & Movement: The Dopamine Connection \n00:07:29 A Double-Edged Dopamine Blade \n00:08:56 Dopamine Fundamentals: Precursor to Adrenalin \n00:10:15 The Reward Pathway: An Accelerator & A Brake \n00:12:10 Motivation= Pleasure Plus Pain \n00:14:14 The Dopamine Staircase: Food, Sex, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamine \n00:16:15 Subjective Control of Dopamine Release \n00:17:40 Social Media and Video Games \n00:18:15 Addiction & Dopamine: Progressively Diminishing Returns \n00:18:48 Novelty, Sensation-Seeking & Anticipation \n00:20:15 Craving: Part Pain, Part Pleasure & Pain Always Prevails  \n00:23:11 Desire Scales With Pain: The Yearning Function \n00:24:43 The Croissant Craving Circuit \n00:25:45 \u201cHere and Now\u201d Molecules: Serotonin, Bliss & Raphe Nucleus \n00:26:26 In Your Skin Or Out In the World \n00:27:25 Cannabinoids Lethargy & Forgetfulness \n00:28:15 The Almond Meditation\n00:29:30 Drugs That Shift Exteroception Versus Interoception \n00:30:36 Emotional Balance, Active & Passive Manipulation \n00:32:36 Procrastination: Leveraging Stress, Breathing, Caffeine, L-Tyrosine, Prescription Drugs \n00:37:04 When Enough Is Never Enough; How Dopamine Undermines Itself\n00:38:58 Dopamine-Prolactin Dynamics: Sex, Reproduction & Refractory Periods \n00:40:30 The Coolidge Effect: Novelty-Induced Suppression of Prolactin  \n00:42:22 Vitamin B6, Zinc As Mild Prolactin Inhibitors \n00:43:25 Schizophrenia, Dopamine Hyperactivity and Side Effects of Anti-Dopaminergic Drugs \n00:45:08 Prolactin, Post-Satisfaction \u201cLows\u201d & Extending the Arc of Dopamine \n00:48:00 The Chemistry of \u201cI Won, But Now What?\u201d \n00:49:00 Healthy Emotional Development: Child and Parent \n00:50:03 Never Say \u201cMaybe\u201d (Reward Prediction Error)\n00:52:02 Surprise! \n00:52:59 Are You Suppressing Your Drive and Motivation By Working Too Late?\n00:54:50 Disambiguating Pleasure and Drive: Dopamine Makes Us Anti-Lazy \n00:58:00 Beta-Phenylethylamine (PEA), & Acetyl L-Carnitine  \n01:00:00 Attention Deficit Disorders, Cal Newport Books, Impulsivity & Obesity \n01:03:55 Leveraging Dopamine Schedules \n01:05:22 Subjective Control of Dopamine and Drug Effects: The \u201cAdderall\u201d Experiment \n01:09:03 Caffeine May Protect Dopamine Neurons, Methamphetamine Kills Them \n01:10:57 Nicotine: Dopamine, Possible Neuroprotection, Prolactin Increase \n01:11:53 Gambling, Intermittent Reinforcement, & Persistent Goal Seeking (Bad and Good) \n01:14:14 Intermittent Halting of Celebration; Enjoy Your Wins, But Not All of Them \n01:18:38 A Story Example of Intermittent Reward to Maintain Long-Term Drive and Motivation \n01:21:25 Corrections & Notes About Spanish Captions & Other Languages Soon \n01:24:00 Synthesis & Framework, Zero-Cost Support & A Note About Sponsors \n\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

I am Dr. Andrew Huberman. \n\nMy plan in creating this podcast is to discuss neuroscience: how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body controls our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health. I will also discuss tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works.\n\nUpcoming episodes will cover: sleep and how to get better at sleeping, learning, dreaming, as well as motivation and focus and how to access more focus. We will also cover neuroplasticity, fear, and stress.\n\nAlong the way, I will discuss behavioral tools (\"do's and don'ts\"), and the role of nutrition, exercise, supplements, prescription drugs and electronic devices for measuring and changing the way our nervous systems work.\n\nTo suggest additional topics, please enter them in the comment section below. Also, be sure to \"like\" any comments suggesting topics you're interested in. I will shape the content of future podcasts accordingly.\n\nThank you for your interest in science!\n\n-Andrew\n\nSocial & Website\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n#HubermanLab\n\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac - https://www.blabacphoto.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4b6bwcWK6GE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4b6bwcWK6GE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4b6bwcWK6GE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4b6bwcWK6GE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4b6bwcWK6GE/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Andrew Huberman", "playlistId": "UU2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg", "position": 202, "resourceId": {"kind": "youtube#video", "videoId": "4b6bwcWK6GE"}, "videoOwnerChannelTitle": "Andrew Huberman", "videoOwnerChannelId": "UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg"}, "contentDetails": {"videoId": "4b6bwcWK6GE", "videoPublishedAt": "2020-12-23T15:00:05Z"}}]
